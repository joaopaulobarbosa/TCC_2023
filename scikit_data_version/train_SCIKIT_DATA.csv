Boy, hats off to any Cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put
down Braves fans.  I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutive
world series.  Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it to
all the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that
infernal cheer that they have.  

However, I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid.  The
way I see it, either I'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observation
was just plain wrong.  You might have us confused with Bear fans. ;)

Anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubs
would finish up last in their division.  (Even behind Florida?!?  Sheesh!)  
These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respective
division.  Well,  we're ten games into the season and these people are a little
less vocal now.  I wonder why.

Well, the way I see it, the East is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most is
going to take it, with the exception of Florida.  Every team seems to have
good batting and pitching, with Philly presently leading the pack.  But, I just
have to point out, if the Cubs do take the East, they'll do it without the
benefit of a competent manager.  However, and it pains me to say it, the
pennant is going to go to the West.

Just had to get that off my chest.

Same engine, different state of tune (less hp and maybe more torque). My
friend at work regularly takes 6 people in his and it seems to haul around

A Sea Doo is a boat. It turns by changing the angle of the duct behind the
propeller. A waterski bike looks like a motorcycle but has a ski where each
wheel should be. Its handlebars are connected through a familiar looking
steering head to the front ski. It handles like a motorcycle.

Hi boys and girls.  I just bought a Beemer R80GS and realized abruptly that 
I am a grad student.  I first sold my truck yesterday but I need to sell my 
Zephyr too.

If I can sell it this month, great ... insurance and tags both run out in
a couple of weeks.  Otherwise I'll tag and insure it and see what happens.

It's a very sweet bike.  6100 miles, almost all highway (AZ-WY-CO last summer,
plus some great rides between here and the Border.  Purchased new exactly
one year ago (Apr '92), it's a '90 model.  It has a good fairing and a
luggage rack.  Red; very clean.  Perfect maintenance, no bullshit.   I'll spare
any further details other than to say (1) I want to keep it, and (2) somebody
5'7 +/- 5 will fit it like a charm.  Not a bike for big people, but not a
small bike.  Standard, upright positioning and good-looking.  Smooth power,
great brakes, good Karma.

     I recently posted an article asking what kind of rates single, male
drivers under 25 yrs old were paying on performance cars. Here's a summary of
the replies I received.
 
 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I'm not under 25 anymore (but is 27 close enough).
 
1992 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (300hp model).
No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1,
airbag, abs, security alarm, single.
 
$1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100
for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base
policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.
 
After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.
 
I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had
and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.
 
Hope this helps.

    (Hope I remembered your name correctly)...
 
    You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year
    I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the
    same inquiry as you.
 
    Age: 24 (then and now)
    Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD
    Driving Record: Clean
    State: Illinois
    Cost: $820/6 mos.
 
    I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos.
    Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.
 
    I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more
    than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe I'm just lucky.
 
    Hope the info helps.

I'm 23; live in Norman, Oklahoma; drive an '89 Thunderbird SC; have
never made a claim against my insurance (though I have been hit
several times by negligent drivers who couldn't see stop signs or
were fiddling with their radios); and I have had three moving violations
in the last 18 months (one for going 85 in a 55; one for failure to
clear an intersection (I still say the damn light was yellow); and
one for going 35 in a 25 (which didn't go on my record)). My rates
from State Farm (with a passive restraint deduction) on liability,
$500 deductible comprehensive, and $500 deductible collision are
roughly $1300/year. (I was paying just over $1100/year for a '92 Escort LX.)

I am beyond the under 25 age group, but I have an experience a few
years ago that might be interesting to you.  I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica
GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners
included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).
I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling
(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less
money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury
car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.
I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i
decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked
about what would happen to my rate with either car.
 
If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as
the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that
year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because
the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue
to handle your account.
 
If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard
[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with
a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,
but cancel you after that.
 
But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually
faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.
 
 That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For
some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -
as very traditional and conservative.
 
I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche
dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure
guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken
a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I
concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto
theft.

I live in Idaho.  When I was <26 many years ago (10 years) I bought a Trans
Am (new).  Insurance was about $1300/year.  When I turned 26, it immediately
dropped to $460/year.  I had not had any accidents before or after, this was
strictly an age change.  That same rate stayed pretty much the same until I
sold the car 2 years ago.  My F-150 pickup is about $80/year less.
 
The real amazing thing is that when I woke up at age 25, I felt SO MUCH MORE
RESPONSIBLE than I was before...  :-)

Mass,
 
	One thing that makes a HUGE difference in MASS is the town you live in.
I'm personally in one of the best towns within reasonable distance
of Boston.  If I moved to the absolute best it would go down to about
$1150, if I moved to the worst it would be $2000+..
 
	Also one accident and a couple of tickets, would probably add another $600...

I have a 1990 Mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd, am 23 years old and have no
tickets that went on my record.  I live in Illinois just outside of Chicago
and pay $1560 a year with full coverage at State Farm.  I did get a small
discount because of my alarm system($30 a year).  I only live 15 miles from
Chicago but if I actually lived in the city the price would be about $2000
a year.
======================================================================== 41
I'm over 25, but in case you're interested anyway, I'm insuring a 93 SHO
for $287/6 month.  Thats 100k personal+300k total+100k property with
250 deductible, glass and towing, State Farm.
 
======================================================================== 39
 
Unless you are under 20 or have been driving for less than 5
years, I think you are being seriously ripped off.  I don't have
one of the performance cars you listed, but if your record is
clean, then you should not be paying over $2K.
 
Did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find?
Although rates are supposed to be standardized, I've found that
most places I initially call, give me some ridiculously high
quote and *finaly*, I hit one that is much lower.
 
Also, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at
renewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a low
rate.  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance
companies 8^).
 
Good luck,
Serge

I ride my bike regularly to classes with my book bag.  I take
the shoulder straps on the bag, and hook them around the rear turn
signals.  I works fine.  You probably will want to attach it with
a bungee cord to keep it from shifting to one side or another.

Summary: Supposed Higher power output.
Distribution: rec.motorcycles
Keywords: Using Splitfire plugs for performance.

Lines: 54


Yo, Whaz up!!!

Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One
guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,
I saw one think that someone said about Show me a team that used Split-
fires....  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories
about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.

Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and
increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires
increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing
on horsepower numbers.

Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that
depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?
In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,
but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.
So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.

But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,
but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for
the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,
twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this
translate?  Increased torque should theoretically help twins make
more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods
or anything made, just stick 'em in.

Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with
somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than
4's.        

As far as racing teams....  Ducati team Fast by Ferraci used
splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James
running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.
Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....

Peace.

Don't forget Robert Blake in Electra Glide in Blue (where else do
you get to see a full-dress Harley playing with dirt bikes?).
And if you're going to count Smokey and the Bandit, then you darn
well better include Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.

   Deltabox (tm) is a registered trademark of Yamaha, used to describe
their aluminum perimeter frame design, used on the FZR400 and FZR1000.
In cross-section, it has a five-sided appearance, so it probably really
should be called a Pentabox.

If you mean Scott Erickson, currently the reigning Twins Least Consistent

They will recound the many public places that they had to bring

I think I've seen this bike.  Is it all white, with a sea-green stripe
and just 'HONDA' for decals, I've seen such a bike numerous times over
by Sewall hall at CU, and I thought it was a race-prepped CBR. 
I didn't see it over at the EC parking lot (I buzzed over there on my 
way home, all of 1/2 block off my route!)  but it was gone.

Is a single sided swingarm available for the CBR?  I would imagine so, 
kinda neccisary for quick tire changes.  When I first saw it, I assumed it
was a bike repainted to cover crash damage.

When it's too windy to stand.

When you're on the road in high winds, stay alert.  Even more alert
than your alert 'cause you're on a motorcycle and they're out to kill
you kind of alert.  Be aware of the terrain, and how it may funnel
wind in sudden gusts (well, not gusts to somebody standing there, but
it's gusty 'cause you ride through it).  If you are riding in a steady
crosswind, be aware of a hill that will block the wind, and adjust your
lean angle.  Be aware of passing trucks to your windward side, your
lean angle will change dramatically both as you enter and as you leave
their turbulance cone.  Reducing your profile may help, ie, lean on the
gas tank and kiss the triple clamp.  Keep a nimble hand on the
steering, be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts.
Keep a larger than usual buffer zone, both ahead and behind, and to the
side, you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by
countersteering.  Keep a close eye on traffic in your mirror, if
someone is coming up wanting to pass, get out of their way early.  Stop
often for short brakes, extensive riding in high winds is both mentally
and physically fatiguing.

Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably

Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,
where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure
of better. The concept is called context, and you should really become
familiar with it someday.

>The facts are that Morris
>has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a WS winning club.
>Clemens hasn't.

Unless this transaltes to Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with
a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to
the Jays, I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.

>You can go on about what Clemens has done in the 
>past and claim that he is better than Morris if you want to.  But 
>the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens
>hasn't.

What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has won 68% of
the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17
wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing
the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If
so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris
allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in
his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But
I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance
to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it
would have been a routine groundout, right?

Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to
you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the
accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that
a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your
continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to
any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have
spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.

No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win
at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the
World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they
keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they
traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link
between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man
was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs
out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,
gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.

Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference
between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,
and why? Did Morris somehow learn how to win in the intervening ten years?
If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half
a run lower than 1992?

about her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems,
ending with engine noises which she said was something
with the heads, that Ford acknowledged the noise, said
they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of
yet.  Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not
the same car).  So I have some evidence of a reoccuring
problem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extension
with the Madza 626 and MX-6.

Anything to this?  I'd love to consider buying the GT (I'm
turning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-)
but I'd hate to find out I just became the proud owner
of a Lemon.

Limited Tort Option will lower your rates. If you choose it, you can't
sue others for pain & suffering, but you still can sue for economic loss.
So you can sue for your wrecked car and for medical bills, but you can't
sue for $1000000 for pain and suffering.

At least, that's how I understand it.

We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational
constant that day:  the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping,
no doubt, with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine
psychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become.  Also, 
recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth 
operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an
instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger.
The other ~5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place 
as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended 
lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its
inexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me).

> You have, I presume, thumbs? Grapple with it and tear it's head
> off!

My very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable 
instruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too
many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard.
There was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near my
car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeon
of dire necessity if ever there was one.  To my amazement and
confusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leapt
to its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally 
looking back at me.  

Seven at One Blow! I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing
my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs
of my domicile.  It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently
knew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque
accurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it.  What I had interpreted
as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt.

I'd like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers. If they see you,
they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle
finger extended. Because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane

The federal government has mandated that all passenger cars by model year

A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has
found that an unacceptable percentage of after dusk collisions were the

i think those with 1.6 MR2's would describe the engine as sweet if a
little loud, those with 2.2 MR2's i can't imagine any unbiased person
paying it any compliments.  sounded like my ex-dormmate's rusty chevy
chevette.  with the 1.6 i would want to redline it just for the music,
with the 2.2 i would short shift so that it would shut up..  the new
camry 2.2 features balance shafts.  i guess since the mr2 is getting
the axe, it is too late for them to do anything about this..

it is no mystery that the turbo mr2 is only 2 liters.. the engineers
had enough integrity to prevent any further abuses.  also, in europe
the MR2 Mk2 non-turbo was also only 2 liters.. as usual, the
undiscriminating american market (if it is japanese it *must* be good)
gets the dogs.. to be fair, we also got the turbo, which the europeans
did not.

Ah, yes, the big chunks down in the sump. The solution is simple. Sort of
like the advice my Aunt always gave -- never scratch your ear with anything

If you have pieces of ring, con rods, valve heads or stems, just reach into
the sump through the hole in the block that was associated with the creation
of those large bits and pieces. Anything you can't remove with one hand 
through the hole in the block may safely be left in place.

While we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget Shea, which
was designed to accommodate both the Mets & Jets.  It was the first
stadium (I think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball & in parallel for football.

Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football
stadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where,
because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the
action.  The Mets announcers--Kiner & Murphy in particular--have
always hyped it as beautiful Shea
Stadium, a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.

>What *does* it take to play on a WS winning club?

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-
tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin-
ing best in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at
the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best
that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the
most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the
best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-
cess  used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re-
lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that
is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-
solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the
only measure of best that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-
ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-
pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-
jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can
predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.

>The fact is that Morris didn't win any ballgames, Toronto did, in
>spite of Morris' contribution.   This has been explained to you

Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with
Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.
I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally
meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on
his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.

>many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.

You don't have to be rude.

>You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.

For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio
Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed
that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of
comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-
formance.

The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new
knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better
than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less 
incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.

Bad driving habits can damage a car in a couple of months, not 6 years.

If that were not the case, everyone would be driving fleet rental re-solds...

And while you are considering things (factors in stat terms), how about
city vs. highway driving ratios, owner vs. dealer service, extreme weather
or environment, adherence (sp?) to maintenance schedules, whether the car
has ever been in an accident, number of different drivers of the same car
in a family, whether the car is garaged, warmed up, ...

But, those chips are probably inside a custom chip, (to make it smaller and
use less power) and the preset/data pins are not going to be available.
It would probably not be TTL but might be CMOS 
(wider operating voltage range), not that the tecnology would make 
much difference.
Plus the custom chip would probably be potted (encapsulated with epoxy).
Good luck.

	Wasn't the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver, so he
could see where he was backing up???  Although reverse lights on the sides
are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the
path of the car, I don't think warnings were their original intents, since they
are colored white.

It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand 
miles.  I don't know why.  I've had three new K bikes, and all three used a
bit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles; this soon quits
and by the time I had 10,000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero.
I've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner
it stops using any oil.

I looked at that Bimmer yesterday. It's an '81, has about 90kmi, according
to owner (odometer stopped working at 68Kmi). Drivess well, sounds good,
body is OK, he wants $3000.
i liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primary
driver on this one, and she wants auto.
The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!)
The A/C seems to have a leak. 
The sunroof is sticky, but operational.
Odometer does not work, as mentioned before.
Idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm.
Wipers are slow.
That's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator, 
rotors and calipers, exhaust.
The biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strange
stories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, how
often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that,
although I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking 
it to a garage. Suspicious. And who knows what milage is on it.
So, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust.
I know there was an article on 528i in R&D a few years back, anybody remembers
what issue?

a couple of things:  blowing a hose doesn't speak of engine reliability, and 
while it is true that quad4's have a problem with head gasket leaks, that was
a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected.  also i know pontiac is
replacing head gaskets that leak for free for 6year/60k miles.  other than
that i have found my quad4 to be completely solid and the direct ignition 
system means no wires/rotor/rotor-cap to ever deal with.  also hydrolic lifters
mean no valve adjustments ever.  i'm not badmouthing the integra engine, i just
think you are going overboard on slamming the quad4.  you are quite correct
that the integra engine is quieter, although i would not say smoother, my
quad4 loves to rev, especially at the high-end.  do you have any evidence
of blocks cracking on quad4s?  i have not heard of this.

   Sorry, but it is *virtually* impossible to win a division with no talent
   over 162 games.

Well, with players, certainly.  However, it is quite possible to win
it all with no managerial talent.  Cf. Blue Jays, 1992.

  greetings:
  you may be in luck.  i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of
the kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a
mould (sp?) off a real kubel, and has adapted it to the beetle
floorpan.  as for the suspension, all i can remember about the
vw thing i used to own is that it had about 3 more suspension
travel than a stock beetle, but i'd heard that there were after-
market parts for off-road use that were as good or better.  note
that the major difference (looks wise) between a kubel & a thing
are the hood and the fenders.  the kubel had an external spare
mounted *on* the hood, and the hood sloped down (for visibility?)
sharply, and had rounded fenders.  the thing has a lightly sloped 
hood with the spare mounted inside (unless moved to make for more
luggage space...) and has half-hexagon shaped fenders (imagine a
nut large enough to put a tire *in*, and cut off the bottom half
of it...).
  unfortunately, i don't have that info anymore.  try stopping
at a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the
two big mag's and calling them.  they might be able to get the
number for you (don't forget to calculate the time difference to
norway before calling...).

later,
kc

The other Jewish HOF'er is Rod Carew (who converted).  

Lowenstein is Jewish, as well as Montana's only representative to the
major leagues.

Undeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish.  Between Stone,
Koufax, Ken Holtzman (? might have the wrong pitcher, I'm thinking of the
one who threw a no-hitter in both the AL and NL), and Big Ed Reulbach,
that's quite a starting rotation.  Moe Berg can catch.  Harry Steinfeldt,
the 3b in the Tinkers-Evers-Chance infield.

Is Stanky Jewish?  Or is that just a Dave Cohen kinda misinterpretation?
Whatever, doesn't look like he stuck around the majors too long.

Well, I never wrote that I would act as you described.  I stated that I 
would not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer
for their own good or for any reason other than I was prevented from 
doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring a
passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances
of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I could
imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your 
chances of being offed or involved in an accident, especially if 
this passer is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person
riding your bumper is certainly NOT a wise driving practice, it 
only causes the jam to become more congested. 
 
I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the 
road behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a pack 
of vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you 
decribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal 
with this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their 
pass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to 
pull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and 
do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I 
feel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the 
actions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers 
on the road who do not intentionally impede others.  

If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they 
are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all 
else fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the 
message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never 
safe to ride anyone's bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking 
traffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty 
or for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least,
derision.       (Sorry this is soooooooo long.)

The biggest hurdle for automatics (IMHO) is not shifting speed
per se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you
try to force it to shift manually.  

This was the biggest fault with the Subaru ECVT -- it took SOOOOOO
LONNNNNNNNGGGGG for the tranny to find the right ratio.

The sales propaganda says the Saturn automatic is effectively an
electronically-shifted manual.  Might this mean that Saturn has
conquered the problem?  (I dunno, only driven Saturn 5-speeds)

INPUT, PLEASE!

Another question:  Any plans for a manual-trans Chrysler LH?
Does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo?

It's always possible, but if this is the case, I think that there is some

this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement.  I did not say, 
nor did I imply, that I could predict the future.  You have inferred
that my comments meant this, and you have based your rebuttal of my
comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that
there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in
regard to clutch hitting.

That is *your* opinion that Sabo is clearly a better hitter than
Samuel.  The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season.
Last season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted).
This season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more
at bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better
hitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been
a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo.

I did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a
hit.  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or
even a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that
situation than Sabo.

I must say, I was not aware of the publication.  Can you email me the

And I guess I must apologize to all of those who have done extensive

Well, actually, I haven't yet.  But I'm not finished looking.
That is, I haven't yet found someone who hit significantly below
his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years 
1989 - 91, and then reversed that relationship in 1992.

Nope.  Sorry.  But if you were interested in a reason why I expect
Chris Sabo's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one
year to the next, I think I could.  If you were interested in a
reason why I expect Joe Carter's ability to hit in the clutch to
correlate from one year to the next, I think I could.  But you're
not interested in that, because you think that those conclusions
could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire
baseball population.  And they can't be.

The problem here is that I *do* believe you.  I accept your work.
I believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based
on prior clutch history is meaningless.  No better than a coin toss.
I actually *do* accept your work.

As it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations,
for certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to
hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be
valid in projecting future player performance.  For that player.
And Chris Sabo is one such player.


>So tell me?  Does the term fit?  Or do you have an open mind?

Well, since I defer to your statistical wisdom, I think I must have
an open mind.  Now we have to pose the same question to you.

just out of curiosity, how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro
transmission.  What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little
i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs
and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,
that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?

Just an comment:  I don't like it when people decide what's good for me...
If you think you're going to decide anything for me, you'd better be 
carrying a badge and a gun.  Who made you capable of determining if there
is no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere?  Why do you find 
it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own 
business?  If someone is minding their own business, I will give them
all the room they want, and I'll try to make things easy for them, even
letting them in in front of me if they ask politely (with a directional).
On the other hand, if someone like you decides they want to block me and
be a general asshole, you can bet your ass that I'll make life as 
miserable as possible for you, as long as it doesn't affect anyone else
who's minding their own business.  
They have a phrase to describe someone like you:
Self Appointed Traffic Police.
Just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong.

I just visited the NY Auto Show, and saw two LH cars on the floor: Eagle 
Vision and Dodge Intrepid. 

Really nice I must say. Very attractive styling, lots of features and room, 
at a competitive price.  

Unfortunately, the workmanship is quite disappointing. On BOTH cars,
the rubber seals around the window and door fell off. It turns out
the seals are just big grooved rubber band. It goes on just by pressing
the groove against the tongue on the door frame. Surely it would come
off easily.

I am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineering/assembly
problems that will show up later.

I may still consider buying it, but only when it establishes a good
track record.

I heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than
gas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide,
Hydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen.  (CO, HC, NOX).

But they can put out a lot of particulate matter.  I heard
something about legislation being discussed to clean up
diesel emissions.  Is there anything in the works to
install scrubbers for diesels?  How about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars?  Would it be any
different than a catylitic converter?  I'd assume easier,
since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses.  Let's hear people's opinions...

I suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning.  An
outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a
lot of balls, preventing both singles and doubles, and also cut off more
uncatchable balls, turinging doubles into singles.  However, a fielder
who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; this
means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.

Has anyone seen these players' positioning?  Do Butler and Felix play
deep, and Lankford, Martinez, and Wilson shallow, or is this a park
effect?  I thought Butler liked to play shallow.

1954 MG-TF with frame-up restoration in early '70's - a local show winner!
Driven very little and stored inside since then - mostly collected dirt &
dust.  Needs attention to brake cylinders (like all MG-T's) but otherwise
ready to run.  Chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent.
The engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop.  It is
priced at $12,000.

1953 MG-TD Good shape but hasn't been run since '70's.  Needs engine work,
but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and
carpet that were new and haven't seen the outdoors since the '70's. $9,500.

1952 MG-TD Basket Case.  I'd call it a parts car, but it's too good
for that.  Everything seems to be there except the tach.  Would make
a good project car or parts car if you insist.  No apparent rust but the
upholstery is a disaster.  Stored inside since the '70's.  The top was
new but now soso.  This one has wire wheels!  Looking for $4,500.

All three cars will be sold as they stand with no hassles or haggles.
Time has passed by and it is time to part company.  Prices are negotiable.

Not an astute observation -- this is a straw-bullpen.  The lefties,
Stanton & Mercker are strong, and Wohlers is down learning a new pitch.
The bullpen is fine, probably superior.

Also false.  Gant, Nixon, Justice, Hunter, Blauser present a decent enough
offense.  EVERYONE is slumping (except Blauser), not just Pendleton.

BTW, what is the story with Brian Hunter?  Is he in the dog house?

Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of
your predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more
measured. Be that as it may....

>1. Roger and Frank are in vintage form, and the Sox are rresponding to them.
Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond
what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are
responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely
suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give
Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.

>2. Greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries.
This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown
much power yet, though.

>3. Dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him.
How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's
Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing
those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe
it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as
well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.

>4. Russell is finishing well.
In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?

>5. Fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter.
A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that
Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of
small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd
be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware
that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as
long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.

>6. Cooper is hitting well (I think he'll be better then Boggs in the field
>and just as good at the plate)
Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the in the field part, and I think he'll be
better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll
be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little
luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,
Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).

>If the sox Pitch like last year (they have a better pitchiong staff, now)

See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500
is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like could run away with
the division are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white
coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If
Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch
just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could
be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too
stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas
continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a
lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

1 hr/drink for the first 4 drinks.
1.5 hours/drink for the next 6 drinks.
2 hours/drink for the rest.

These are fairly cautious guidelines, and will work even if you happen to 
have a low tolerance or body mass.
I think the cops and Don't You Dare Drink & Drive (tm) commercials will 
usually say 1hr/drink in general, but after about 5 drinks and 5 hrs, you 
could very well be over the legal limit. 
Watch yourself.

Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room.
Fully stocked, it cost ~$40,000.  I think it is worth the money.
Only problem is when you get into accident(it doesn't usually break down
unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something
stupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate. 
Parts are over priced also.  One of my friend had accident in past snow
storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender.

Well, if you test drive Land Cruiser, all other SUV look like toys.
One of magazine writer called it Land Bruiser.  

If you have $40,000 to spare for SUV, get Land Cruiser and forget Lange Rover.

I purchased a used 1988 Nissan 300ZX (non-turbo) last year.  I had a 
question on gear/rpm ratios.  Right now in 5th @65mph I'm at 
2600-2700 rpms.  @70mph I'm at about 2900rpms.  Is this about the
norm?  I'm an auto neophyte so I'm just wondering if these are
the proper ranges?  Somehow the rpm figures seem high.  A friend of mine
just told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 Chevy Beretta (2.8l V6.)
Also, anyone know the top speed attainable (@redline???) for this model Z?

But why McGwire, and not Carter?  I can see some justification for Bonds or
Thomas, because they tend to have higher batting averages, but the major
difference I see between McGwire and Carter is that Carter doesn't draw
walks.  Why aren't pitchers afraid to throw strikes to Carter?

anyone would think that the Braves (or any other team, for that matter)
should get the title for free.  What a dolt that person would be, if

     This is not really true.  Excluding last season, the Giants
has been a better 2nd half team.  In 1991, they had a hot August
to pull to within a few games of the Braves and Dodgers before
fading in September.
     The Giants may go back to earth, but not as fast as last
season for two reasons:
(1)   Barry Bonds
(2)   Roger Craig is no longer the manager.  Dusty can manage
      his pitching staffs much better than Craig.

This is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. Selig needs to do
is to suspend Bobby Cox.  You *cannot* allow a team to come out at
the ump as the Braves did.  I usually rip umps, but in this case,
the players were dead wrong.  Cox should go for 5 games.  If I
had ever umped a game where that happened, I'd have ejected every
player that came out.  Only Cox and Gant would have been spared, and
then Cox would have gone in the ensuing argument.

Why?  Do you suppose he's immune to the ravages of time?  He's 37.  
In a few years he'll be 40.  He doesn't get to as many grounders as
he used to, and will get to fewer still as his legs go, as they do
on every human so far.

Remember: Willie Mays was a defensive liability at he end of his
career too.  Ditto Mickey Mantle.  Ditto just about everyone else who 
played into their late 30's.

Women's pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too
shallow to use!

I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when
she goes from building to a car. It is protect herself from
would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who
as a definite place of safty (ie a locked car!).

Puting keys and walet looks ugly! It breaks the lines and makes
you rear look wide as a cows!

 Also, to have the habits that
work for any clothing situation, the pruse functions no mater
what you are wearing! (even nude or a bikni)

A women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets (2 on the outside,
none on the inside). I have men's coats that have as much as 6
pockets! This is definitally not fair!!!

As one that wears both men's and women's clothes, I can tell you,
women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets!

When dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and
my keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent
than the pants pockets and looks better.

Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is
paramout to a woman's safty. Men don't see this as a problem.
A woman is aware of this every time she goes out! (i.e.
Image some red necks yelling at you We are going to FUCK YOU!
and the out weight you by 20 lbs and have 3 inches in hight
on you!)

If you want to find out why a women does something, LIVE AS ONE!

This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform
the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed
fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the
previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the 
dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed 
legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that
the odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has
to report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer,
and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that
the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo 
was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must 
be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage 
of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is 
affixed to the door frame of the vehicle. 

Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search
(which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.

Call your state's Department of Transportation/Public Safety/Motor
Vehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what your
rights are. Your state's Attorney General will know for certain ;-)

No comparison. The BEL is just a hooped up wideband Escort like detector.
No directional indicators, no Bogey counter, no radar signature analysis, no
remote display option, not as sensitive, not as well built.

Bottom line:  I did it and it worked.

Some 'tips and techniques' are included here:

I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks.
And a can of WD40 helped...

The sockets needed were metric (exact fit) but I was able to use
some SAE sockets...  13/16 and 15/16 are rather close to 21 and 24mm...
It CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford ...

Didn't have to undo the end bolts/bushings.  Just the 2 U bolts on
each side and the shock absorber.  Jacking up the frame some more
(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden 
platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to
raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring
free of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to
undo the pin holding the spring pack together.

The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head
on the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...
I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.

Flipped the bottom spring and then...

>(OK, well, maybe it's not _that_ easy, but it's not terribly

I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a
1911A1 ...

A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt
nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of
torque spec ...

It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  
Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on
with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth
and sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together
while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go
to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.

Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...
until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.

One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential
tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right
hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling
forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an
hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block
with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a 
break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD
been lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must 
have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move 
it back... hmmm...).

After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.

BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.
At least it now sits level..

Personally, I think Jeffy-Poo was still smarting more from the third degree
burns he suffered after April 1st last year rather than the supposed burns
that he suffered in the joke.  Granted I was one of those people that were
taken in by it and I was certainly concerned...and then pissed at him for 
pulling such a thing (which I made known to him).

But then again, for an April Fool joke I would also go on record as saying
that it was the best orchestrated one I've ever seen and it certainly sucked
a LOT of people into believing it 8-( 8-| 8-\ 8-)...

Bzzt.
The manta was a two-door sedan in the US.
It had a 1900 engine.
Was sometimes referred to as an Opel 1900.
Manta's are also ve hot and fun cars too.

  This last comment was obviously a bit cynical, but a true statement of
 the attitude of some drivers (there's your autos content), I would say.

  What law-abiding (not low-abiding as above (talk about Freudian slips!))
 citizens have the right and responsibility to do is try to PREVENT this
 type of behaviour in children.  A doctor may have to use deadly force
 against a part of a body (like amputating it) when an infection/disease

 disease in the first place or at least nip it in the bud.

  Nice ridin' Tex. I use the California DMV recommended technique:
slow as you aproach said dog and wick it up as you pass. I've often
contemplated putting the boot in said dog's muzzle as I open the 
throttle, but have never tried that. I figgure the impact would 
unballance me and I'd dump the bike. A bicycling technique I've
employed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog
attacks. On one occasion I was attacked by a pack of four dogs at
once while peddaling up a steep hill. I lost my right sock, but no
blood. I complained to the local Animal Control department (after
complaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect) about the dogs;
no more dogs, no more attacks. The telephone worked much better
than the tire pump.

Mr. Hernandez Ñ-
  
   I apologize for the misunderstanding.  I explained that I know that it
is essential for some fans to get scores here, for they cannot get them
elsewhere.  I have no problem with what you do, posting scores AFTER the
games have been completed.  However, like I said earlier, I don't think it
is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games, like some others
have come to practice.

concerning Saab cars.  It will allow participaants to exchange
information on purchasing, maintaining, repairing, and outfitting
Saabs.

	rec.autos.saab

Status:

	Unmoderated

Rationale:

	There may be enough people with Saab cars or interested in
	buying a Saab or interested in knowing more about Saabs for any
	reason to justify such a new newsgroup.  The recent growth of
	the net could improve the turnaround time between posing a
	question and receiving answers from the community.

Discussion:

	Comments on this proposed new newsgroup should be posted to the
	USENET Newsgroup news.groups.  If the reader is not able to
	do so, comments may be e-mailed to the proposer, at the address

Sure.  I've never been much of a racerboy, as anybody who's attended the
Minibike Spectacular can attest.  ;^)  I get a great deal of satisfaction
in riding fast, yet now so fast as to be overly concerned about not being
able to maintain a clean line.  And while I'm still known to slide the
occasional tire, I much prefer to stay just to the sticky side of that
line.  I've found that I don't heal as well as I used to in days of yore.

However, I feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings (see 
top).  Your statement of 'responsibility' is felt as an attack towards the 
members of this group.  You are attempting to make the members of this group
be REQUIRED to answer.  The only people who should make a statement are people
who have experienced the problem and found a workable solution.

Many people are interested, but have no input.  I will restate that your last
sentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group.  If people have
input, they will give it.  If they do not, YOU should not make them feel 
compelled (sp?) to respond.  

If you wish to continue this conversation, PLEASE send e-mail.  DO NOT repost or
attempt to bait me, I will not make another post (and may I make the same a
suggestion to other group members) on this matter.

I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have
some comments to share.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get
the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has 
aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather
weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.

The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a
waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the
officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a
waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to
show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He
showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if
you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told
him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book
and said It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you
a ticket for it right now. Well, won't argue with that...

Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the
tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the
library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police
that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't
get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering
a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.

So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from
the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience
registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station 
later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I
could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide
to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do
I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?

Any comments about it will be welcome!

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time,
it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they 
have it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73
Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom.

Be VERY careful about this. If youre really cold the muffler will
feel fine till you leave all the charred skin on it when you peel
your hands off - I speak from experience. You can also do all 
kindsa (Americanism of the day) damage to your circulation warming 
hands up on something too hot. By far the best (fastest and safest)
way to do it is to shove the hands up the opposit sleeves and
stand there like a Ming emporer for a while. Five minutes should 
do it.

My Honda has a cable release that can be locked out with the ignition key.
The valet key can be left with someone and will NOT unlock the trunk
or enable the cable release.

I remember my mothers '86 Corvette that had an electronic hatch release
located on the drivers door, which was ALWAYS active.  The fact that the
car had no real trunk makes the security measure of beign able to 
dis-able the hatch release unnecessary.

I bought a set of ARE's a few months back and decided to add locks

Yep.  They are popular vehicles.  You don't see a lot of previous model year
ones sitting on dealer's lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are
out.  The things sell, they are popular.

Because they are popular, and high-priced new, they are high price used, very
simple.

I knew they were overpriced when I bought it... I knew they had a terrible 
reliability record when I bought it.  But I didn't expect anything like I
got, especially with a dealer network unable to repair it.  Personal experience
has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine.

The tater that Jack Morris served to Griffey the Younger in his first

my scorecard at home).  I think that's the longest so far in the Kingdome
through the first stand (five games) there.  A weak showing, despite some
promising taterball candidates ... Ben McDonald, Rich DeLucia, and the
rest of the Mariner bullpen ... making appearances.

Anyone have the tape-measure value for Omar Vizquel's grand slam in the

I would also be interested in finding out about the '94 Talon,
and I suspect that many other people would be interested too,
so let's get some responses on the net.

The question again:
Does anyone have any info on the 1994 Eagle Talon / Mitsubishi
Eclipse / Plymouth Laser?

I know that the old Talon was based on the Mitsubishi Galant,
and that in Japan, a 240 hp twin-turbo V6 1994 Galant has been
released.

So anyway, any info on the '94 Talon would be appreciated.

You do have the power Steve. You *can* do it. Why don't you? Why don't you
go shoot some kids who are tossing rocks onto cars? Make sure you do a good

It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call
some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than
you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)
>
>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?

For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get
both feet on the ground when you stop.
 
The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety
Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion
of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you
to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.

Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.

Hmmmm I noticed sometime ago that I could do the same on my Virago, and
since I don't read many schematics, I didn't really think aobut it too
much.   Yes it does provide excellent coverage, but I figured it would
probably draw a little too much current.  I also figured that it was 
overlapped just to prevent a blank spot of no headlight.  Are you saying 
that these switches are designed for the hi/lo combination?

At the time I didn't really want the Sox to sign either.  I was more
than a little worried about Viola's elbow.

But you *surely* remember my shout of relief when, after a week of
rumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox, they ended up with Viola
instead.

Now I'm even happier.  Viola seems to have rebounded nicely.

How long did Viola sign for.  Three years?  I generally agree with
their policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers.  But I
think they enforce it rather too strictly.  These days the premier
pitchers all sign three or four year deals.  Which leaves the Jays
with Morris and Stewart.  If the Jays want to compete for top free
agent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks.

Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris?  Are there any
automatic activation clauses?  What is the buyout amount?f

I'll pick up that PM and have a look -- maybe the picture in there is not
the actual car, but a prototype?

I saw the Mach III and was not all that impressed -- it looked WAY too
Japanese for me... the tear drop headlights reminded me of a Nissan NX...

Glad I didn't hold out for the '94 and bought a '93.  Maybe they'll work on
the design a little bit, listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking
'95 or '96.  It always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design,
e.g. the F-body Camaro/Firebirds (btw, the new Camaros look like shit too).

The quality of autobahns is something of a myth. The road surface
isn't much different to a typical TX freeway. They are better
in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. I'd have
no problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it
for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.

>than most of the roads here. A dip in the asphalt that you test your
>shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130. Don't get me wrong, I love to

It would have to be quite severe. I don't recall any US freeway,
without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe
at 130 in any decent, well damped car. Note that my definition
of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.

>drive quickly and they say my Probe will do 130, but that's 30 more

I don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried
about cops, other traffic etc. than the road surface at 130.
It just isn't that fast or that dangerous. If you have a Probe
GT, no problem. The 4cyl models I have driven would be
likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds.

Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,
along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with
autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a
manual.

(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the
money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to
drive through the slushbox.)

As automatics become more efficient, the bigotry is probably
reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are
cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there
aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.

Okay DoD'ers, here's a goddamn mystery for ya !

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there
was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension
to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very
tangible thunk.  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. 
My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such
that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the
lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a bank-follower, or a
little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a
100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7
mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the
mystery.

The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm
fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of
the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in
the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something
having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  

Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you
rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without
damaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo
that Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly
changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid
?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, life
goes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.

  So, in short, the 3/8 cables seems to be pretty useless, I would guess.

Because, unlike the UK, passing the average driving test over here

Prestone.  I buy it at ShopKo for less 
than that a _gallon_.    BMW has even more
expensive stuff than Kawasaki (must be 
from grapes only grown in certain parts of
the fatherland), but BMW Dave* said Don't 
worry about it -- just change it yearly and
keep it topped off.  It's been keeping 
Gretchen happy  since '87, so I guess it's OK.

Kept my Rabbit's aluminum radiator hoppy for
12 years and 130,000 miles, too, so I guess
it's aluminum safe.

My T-Bird SC's manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60,000mi.
Wal-Mart has Autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. Are these real
platinum plugs? (I had Bosch platinums in my '80 Fiesta and my dad
had 'em in his '84 Bronco--note the keyword had. They didn't last
very long (much less than 50,000mi) before they had to be replaced.
I agree that they weren't the greatest.)

I'm considering switching to Geico insurance, but have heard that
they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim.  I was
worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim.  I have
also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident.

I'm interestend in determining whether or not these things are true.
Has anyone out there with Geico made a claim?  I'd be interested in
hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether
you then had trouble renewing your policy.

I'm also interested in any good or bad stories about Liberty Mutual or
State Farm.

	To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three
homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the 
Cards and the Yanks.  He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In
case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe
Ruth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan
Gonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that 
he had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record
books at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I 
am wrong.  
	Onto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I
can't get McPaper consistently around here.  
comment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals
that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could 
hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish
with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  
leadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm 
lucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals
already.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I
haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going
to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this
year is stealing bases.
Sheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.
Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,
or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.
Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is 
this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone 
seen him pitch the two good games?
score for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the
Cardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.  Sheffield and Tueful also homer
in a winning cause.

o Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00
     This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 
     & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels 
     & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater 
     & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, 
     doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument 
     panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body 
     electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). 
     These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals.  They are for 
     model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that 
     applies to other years as well.


And, as long as I'm posting (end of car stuff),

o Miscellaneous Darkroom Equipment ........................ $75.00
     Solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and 
     timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc.
     printing masks.  Developing tanks, thermometer, trays, 
     constant-temperature bath, ground glass, mirrors, darkroom
     lamps, glassware, el-cheap-o tripods..... and (as they say)
                             MUCH   MORE!


o Beautiful Antique Buffet ............................... $1500.00
     Solid cherry (no veneer).  Handmade, with very interesting
     dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around 
     1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant 
     piece of furniture, but too big (60 long, 37 tall, 24 
     deep) for our little Cape Cod house.


Will deliver pricier items (ie, over $10) anywhere in the Rochester

of it on UofR Campus between now and graduation.

Sorry Len, this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs.
Being overweight and having no work ethic, leading to being injury prone with
nothing to loose, might have been corrected in Richmond.  (Did you intend a 
smiley after your comment?)

This brings back the long suffering memories of pre-chop Braves fans who
kept being promised the Bob Horner - Dale Murphy back to back power slam.  Who
could stop that?  Guess we'll never know.

P.S. - Rocky fans (are there any yet?)  Is Dale getting any playing time out
there?  I plan to be at the game on June 28th, they'll have to play him then.

me warm, or it will carry more cargo.  If the four wheeler has as much
collision protection as the average motorcycle, then it has enough form me.

You all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees
all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the
expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.

The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised
anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the
Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in
June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins
dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.

Okay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive
calculation, I thought this did pretty well.

Hm.  Pete Smith made the rotation instead of Mercker.  And Bielecki

Right on Blauser.  Wrong on Bream and Mitchell.  A bit early on

The Orioles finished seven games out.  None of them won 20 (though

Except for the Brewers (who you probably forgot), you were right!  The
rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  The Yankees and Indians
led with 76 wins, the Red Sox trailed with 73 wins.  None were
horrible, but four were five or more games below .500.

Mel is alive and well and playing in Japan. (The Yanks let him go because
he was asking for too much money, and because they thought that they were
going to get Barry Bonds, making Hall obsolete. Oopsie! Well, at least
they got O'Neill to replace the Mel-man).

It's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit
to an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he
makes a not too sucessful living selling them.

Without further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:


1) Servotronic steering:

[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the
name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and
used in Audis and BMWs.]

I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past
couple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of
the Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to
report now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I
suppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been
loaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that
I have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much
happier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no
longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is
ruined.

The steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I
suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that
some makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel and
there is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room for
improvement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than the
Japanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in
feel and engineer it out completely.


2) Engine

Wheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did
not expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be
putting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific
punch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it
encourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so
supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2
liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a
fashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm
redline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which
translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A
chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.
The technical achievement is breadthtaking.

Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In
fact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts
are almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the overboost feature
than to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features
up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like
lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the
right foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a
few moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,
maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb
ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to
develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite
a heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado
VR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding
in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one
is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the
turbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very
refined but bland sounding 5 banger..

Yes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as
serene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite
up to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say that
in terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of
harshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,
lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark
that made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.
The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under
full boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more
musical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical,
with a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can
match its grunt.

The only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking
off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra
inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat
delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. 
Alternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price
to pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should
offer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in
extremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The
characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,
in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the
slush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...


3) Chassis

I've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively
modest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..
which is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke
wheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge
whatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth
watering macho, yet subdued look. 

On rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body
style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as
road noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I
digress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved
out of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough
roads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers
do not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will
never worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or
pony cars.

The servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to
be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was
able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I
think a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,
talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a
banked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I
went around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the
skin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and
completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the
limits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were
thrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely
uninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of
story.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those
reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical
efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.

The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty
well too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too
surprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi
100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more
wooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the
luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by
additional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing to
brag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these days
seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on
anti-lock capability.


4) Comfort

For a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also
excellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel
inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expected
gizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this
and that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed
because Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the
car has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how
much the turbo dominates its performance.  

Unusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as
well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.

Noise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't
consider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough
to sway a potential buyer.


5) Conclusion

Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price
of $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to
offer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if
it doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker
offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is
worth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also 
top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant 
automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series
Audis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my
thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being
all out exciting and intoxicating.

How many runs will be scored in Denver?
I don't know.

but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in 
Mile High Stadium during the last few years of the Bears/Zephyrs 
tenure in the American Association.

Here's the total runs scored per game in Zephyrs games, 
all league games and the ratio. I found the same ratios for HR.

Year  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio   
1992 10.22  9.10 1.12   1.65 1.58 1.04
1991  9.53  8.87 1.07   1.41 1.26 1.12
1990 10.71  8.72 1.23   1.49 1.24 1.20
1989  9.07  8.34 1.09   1.27 1.11 1.14
1988  9.90  8.37 1.18   1.29 1.08 1.19
1987 12.55 10.70 1.17   2.39 1.92 1.24
1986  9.45  9.33 1.01   1.35 1.38  .98
1985  9.50  8.54 1.11   1.53 1.34 1.14
1984  9.99  9.10 1.10   1.55 1.59  .97
1983 10.60  9.99 1.06   2.03 1.74 1.17
1982 11.29 10.35 1.09   2.24 1.91 1.17
1981 10.29  9.25 1.11   1.43 1.49  .96
1980 10.59  9.43 1.12   1.63 1.46 1.12
      1446/13-->1.11     1444/13-->1.11

It seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect 
on runs scored (I'll stick with my prediction from last year 
that it'll be one of the top 3 in the NL this year) 
and a fairly large effect on Homeruns - though apparently not as large as 
Atlanta, Wrigley, Cincinnati and San Diego.
Still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park.

Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both

shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.

     Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors
so

liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if
something

isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When

certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential

A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable
locks under the Kryptonite name.

When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite 
U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for
a new lock for the bicycle.

For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock
(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,
Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).
I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in
disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.

First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by
the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of
quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable
lock with the Kryptonite name on it.

Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I
don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often
quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes
it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.

Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves
the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the 
dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the 
lock mechanism would stand up to an insert screwdriver and TORQUE
attack.

Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to 
deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the
weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient
you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go 
through the cable in well under a minute.

- Plan your gas stops in major-city areas to avoid the 25 cent-per-gallon
only gas station for 50 miles and you're an out-of-towner surcharge.

- Prepare your car.  Don't forget things like your fuel & air filters.  If
you're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff
just in case of a flat.  In my x-country trip, a tire disintegrated in the
California desert & it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to

- If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help
keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft.

- McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms.

- invest in a $30 CB & magnetic roof antenna.  It may help if you're stranded,
and you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc.

- Many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a
new state, to catch all the speeders who have escaped the previous state.

- Same as above; when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of
65mph rural interstate

Wilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year

The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in
gear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and
stall my bike.  And I figure this is more likely than the chance that
I'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time
needed to put the bike in gear.

So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second
evasive manuvers.  I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line.
(Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  If I can't
split (perhaps there isn't room) then I will stop near one side of the
lane so I have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next
car has stopped.  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure
it will!  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to
stop, I haven't had to find out yet.  Some cars have an annoying habbit
of racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to
tell if they are planning to brake or not!

So in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch your
mirrors until it's all clear.

  A while back I asked for help in defending a traffic ticket I received.
 In short:
     The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. Given the conditions
   I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the
   intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident.
   A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left
   and gave me the ticket.
     The officer said The only reason that you even slowed down in the first
   place was that you saw me approaching, otherwise you would have bombed right
   through


  I would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for
 help. To all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine:
 PHGHGHGHGH..

 The judge sided with me and decided that in this case Not stopping was the
 safest thing to do and found me NOT GUILTY.

  The officer's statement and my account of the conditions at the time (very
  slippery, backed by newpaper weather conditions) were the factors what made
  the judge decide on his verdict.


  Moral: If you have never been to court before and you think you have a case,
	 go for it. It is a very interesting process, and it is there for
	 your benefit. Exercise your rights.

  The event that had the most impact on Gaetti's career was his leg injury
in 1988.  His performance dropped radically from 1988 to 1989.  He was 
still with the Twins in 1989 and 1990, but if you look at his stats (both
offensive and defensive), he never has come back to his pre-injury level.

This tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog's conformance to
a psychological norm that may not actually apply to a particular dog.
I've tried it with some success before, but it won't work on a Charlie Manson
dog or one that's really, *really* stupid.  A large Irish Setter taught me
this in *my* yard (apparently HIS territory) one day.  I'm sure he was playing 
a game with me.  The game was probably Kill the VERY ANGRY Neighbor Before

I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show, and would like to 
hear your comments.

MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this
product really impressive, if it didn't cheat.

The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is
half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor
is powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against
the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. 
The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.

Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft
of torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was 
added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of
torque. 

Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, 
you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.

They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz
bottle is $25.

I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was
so little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't
believe it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against
my common sense.

Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?
If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the 
second floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.

I told a newbie friend of mine, who was having trouble from the complicated

to lean right. It worked for him, he stopped steering with his tuchus.

If you had free reign to design your own instrument cluster, which
gauges would you choose to have beyond the basic set?

I consider the basic set to be:

	- tach

	- coolant temp (or cylinder head temp for air-cooled engines)
	- oil pressure
	- amps

	- speedo
	- fuel

others that are nice to have:

	- volts (maybe this should be in the basic set)
	- vacuum/boost

I can think of a few others, but what are your ideas and why?

	You can forget this line of reasoning.  When an animal
decides to take you, there's nothing you can do about it.  It has
something to do with their genetics.  I was putting along at a
mere 20mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it (as in,
just like bad concrete), and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped a
fence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me!  When I saw her jump
the fence I went for the gas, since she was about 20 feet ahead
of me but a good forty to the side.  Damn cow literally chased me
down and nailed me.  No damage to cow, a bent case guard and a
severely annoyed rider were the only casualties.  If I had my
shotgun I'd still be eating steak.  Nope, if 2200lbs of cow
can hit me when I'm actively evading, forget a much more
manueverable dog.  Just run them over.

	Professionals who train guard dogs, when polled, gave themselves a
1 in 4 chance of survival tackling a trained dog unarmed.  A trained guard
dog is not to be trifled with.  An untrained mutt may be another story.

ObMoto:  A local dog used to chase me all the time.  Really annoying.  I 
finally started stopping every time he'd chase me.  He didn't know what to do
then and would usually just slink off the road.  After a couple weeks of this
he stopped chasing me altogether.  He would still chase cars or other bikes,
though.  I think he recognized me when I went by ;-).

Since the wheel/tire is balanced off the car i.e. the lugnuts are

since the lugs are so close to the center of rotation any slight
difference in weight between a normal lugnut and a locking one would

My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or
something. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the
approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,
then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it
didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my
house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to
the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to
the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to
harm.

But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the
roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph
for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the
left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he
had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,
heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I
saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took
the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was
driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent
marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think
I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this
moment is hazy.

I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The
apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut
mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my
shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.
So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!

Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never
moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike
off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some
gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me
here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.

What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have
prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not
necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was
riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if
it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the
thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a
blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are
long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?

I eagerly await comment.

i have a grand am with auto and quad4.  around the gear selector there is a 
plastic strip which covers the space so you can't see inside.  anyway...i took
the cover off and cut the end of this long strip to a specific length, the 
strip curls up into a cirlce at one end inside.  anyway, by doing this the 
strip can't feed into the lip that circles it,,,,so...i can push button, pull
down and the gear shifter will only go back to 2 from drive,,,no accidental
hitting first.  i drive around town in 2 to keep the revs up.  shift to drive
above 50 and pull down to 2 when coming up to lights..if i want.  if i am
eating food...i drive in drive.  there are probably aftermarket shift kits
that will accomplish the same thing.  porsche's tip-tronic automatic can be 
driven like an auto...or put into +/- mode.  tip up...upshift...tip down...
downshift.  of course there is an override so you don't redline the engine.

This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi
perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every
time there is a game-winning hit.  The clutch pitching quoted above is
something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should
be expected to be a clutch pitcher.

Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch
hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points,
standard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league,
just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.

And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between
clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,
probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather
than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to
pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past.

But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.
Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of
Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  Do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?  Do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?

Well, I don't want shorter games *per se*, but I would like for them to stop
*wasting* so much time during games. The Gant incident is a perfect example.
When a guy comes to the plate, he should be up there to hit, not show off
(or show up the umpire, which is clearly what Gant was doing). I feel like
writing a fan letter to Hirschbeck.

I can relate to this. I've tried everything on my 86, greasing every point,

Another vibration seems to get worse with age, and that is a vibration in the

it very easily, no fast off-road stuff. Can't GM build Chevies like they used
to? Ford Explorers look nice, until you look at the price.

I would stongly recommend a factory service manual, and if you are not

Make sure the bike has cooled at least 6 hours since being run.
Read the books and if you have more questions you could mail me.

Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we
have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our
decisions on.

I might as well say We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet
tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.

Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an
absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.

As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't
believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good
season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent
season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to
use.

The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he
hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him
down until he gets warmed up.

>OK.  Most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22 

Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do
with Javy Lopez?

See above.

But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most
players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year
either.

And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.

Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're
being charitable.

>at third and one of the better hitting shortstops.  

Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year
in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a
big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and
has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable
bat... for a shortstop.

>field platoon will probably hit .300.  However good Lopez'

Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be
20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player
with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.

>The kid *will* improve playing at AAA, 

Just like Keith Mitchell did?

>I am just so surprised I have to spell all of this out.  My

That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they
really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,
or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization.

Up to this point, I really thought this had been written by a 
pro-SDCN, anti-mediot poster blessed with a certain talent for
sarcasm and biting remarks.  Somebody like me, for instance.
The lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the

But then the scales were lifted from my eyes.  Looks like Robert is
really being serious.  Oh, well.

I compare the performance of the 1992 Phillies with the 1987 edition,
which had outstanding run producers at every position except SS, yet
finished at a frustrating sub-.500 level.  The 1987 folks didn't 
ever amount to anything, and neither will the 1992 squad, IMHO.

Any other parallels with previous years' teams for this year's
editions (in the style of 1993 Braves = 1971 Orioles)?

They are also unsupervised.  With proper supervision, they would not be

Ed, exactly what kind of mutant horse-like entity do you ride, anyway?
Does countersteering work on the normal, garden-variety, one-necked horse?

Obmoto:  I was flipping through the March (I think) issue of Rider, and I

It mentioned something about a signal for Your passenger is on fire.  Any

This should not be understood as implying that I have grown sociable enough

Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which
is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some
interesting features.  This year, the predictions/team analyses for
the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics.  I
don't have the article in front of me, so I'll only give the memorable
ones here that I remember and know the melody to.  I could dig up more
if there is interest.

Yankess (to the tune of Subterranean Homesick Blues)

Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine.
George is on the pavement thinking 'bout the government.
Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off,
Says he's got a bad back, wants to get it laid off.
Look out kids, it's somethin' you did.
Don't know when, but it's Columbus again.

Mets (to the tune of Like a Rolling Stone)

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime, didn't you?
People said Beware Cone, he's bound to roam
But you thought they were just kidding you.
You used to laugh about, 
The Strawberry that was headin' out.
But now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud,
About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal....

Phillies (to the tune of Highway 61)

Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun,
Just keep them off of Highway 61!

Giants (to the tune of The Ballad of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter)

This is the story of the Magowan,
The man St. Petersburg came to pan,
For something that he never done,
He sits in the owner's box but one...
Day he could have been the Tampian of the world!

lead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete
game. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score,
and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out.
So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.

Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his
life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks
lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, I don't want a repeat of that
near-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work. Steve Howe,
whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't
do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the
Royals win it, 6-5.

What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that
the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together,
Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once. What's the
deal? We finally have terrific starting pitching, so all of a sudden, our
bullpen turns to shit!

What's Buck gonna do? And what's George gonna do if this continues to happen?

Hi all,
I have available to me a set of Metric wheels (came off a Mustang or T-Bird)
which are wearing nearly-bald Michelin TRX 220-55R390 tires.  The only place
I have found these tires is the Tire Rack mailorder place for $121 a pop.
Is there a cheaper source, or another manufacturer of this size tire?  Thanks
for any info...please E-Mail responses and I will post a summary if there is
any interest.

Wouldn't you rather have some type of standard electrical plug instead of 
that fire hazard waiting to happen adaptor? I know I would, and I would 
also prefer to have sensibly placed cup holders instead of an ashtray. (my

Alright, beat this automobile sighting.

Driving along just a hair north of Atlanta, I noticed an old, run down
former car dealership which appeared to deal with, and repair, older
rare or exotic foreign sports cars. I saw:

Ford GT-40 (!), the famous model from Ford, that seemed to win most of 
its races in the late 60s, including Le-Mans 4 or 6 times.

Two Jensen Interceptors, one a convertable, one a hatchback?

Porsche 911 (boring compared to the rest)

THREE Ferarries, a Mondial, a 308 prepared for racing, and a red 60s model
that I couldn't identify.

And at the bottom, a late 70s MG convertable.

Outside there was a rotting Rover 3500 saloon, which was never regularly
sold in the U.S.

And in the showroom, there was a small italian body, either an Alpha Romeo
or a Lancia. It was about the size of an Austin Mini.
The trunklid was missing, exposing a boot with a voltage regulator 
in the upper left corner of the wall, and a chunk of metal removed from
the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk
and go to the outside from here.
The taillights looked like they
would be the round type (if they were there). Does anyone know what the
make of this one is?  

Certainly made my day...

I'm a biker and a dog-lover.

First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice
between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is
only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put
the dog first.

Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react
to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're
playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which
has hostile intent.

Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social
beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are
two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which
dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the
latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.
But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may
even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh
rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!

Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to
assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a
game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;
when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of
interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so
that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to
react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a
motorcycle is capable of.

With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures
may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important
-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the
road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up
newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will
hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is
that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The
larger the dog, the greater your anger.

Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he
are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he
is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.

Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory
where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are
satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped
punishment.

The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great
deal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the
less you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've
learned a few tricks I think...

Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the
combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this,
then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably
in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC
pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley
Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've
tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain
plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers
are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who
have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,
I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make
the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look
really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)

I grew up listening to Harry Carey call the Cardinals' games and
really liked him--then. But, as I recall, he was fired because
he was too critical (read: honest) when he was announcing. He
dared to point out the Cards' miscues and such. At least, this is
what I remember from when I was a kid.

The New York talk shows are just awful in this regard.  People are constantly
calling WFAN and WABC with (stuff like) I was thinking, why don't the Yankees
trade Kaminicki and Silvestri to Seattle for Ken Griffey Jr and Randy Johnson,
that would really help the team  or Do you think the Yankees can get Roger 
Clemens?.  The show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys, but it's
still annoying.

The best one was at the end of one show, a caller started out with I was 
thinking, why don't the Yankees trade for... and then the host hung up on
him.  I cheered!

They lowered the mound first (before the 69 season).  The shrinkage of

A fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than
them opening your gas tank, dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner,
and sending you on your merry way $59 poorer.  Go to KMart and buy the
cleaner yourself for $1.29.
 
Just because you dealer sez you need it, don't mean it's necessarily so.

Hear, hear!  Thanks, Robbie.

You also don't read that much about violence *against* teenagers, such as
George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi 17-year-olds,
who were trying to surrender, with bulldozers.


On the other hand, I think it *is* true, without singling out teenagers
for blame, that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be.
Those of us who'd like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do
with people of all ages.

	Yeah, maybe that is more likely.  But from the Mariners-Tigers 
series, it seems like every time there are base runners, the pitchers 
seem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass.  The 
funny thing was that Griffey was struggling up until the last game of the
four game series if I remember correctly.

I don't think the 550 sold very well - most North Americans who ride a standard
rather than a sport bike usually want something bigger. People walk into the
dealership, look at the 550 and the 750 and say, I might as well spring the
extra bucks for the bigger engine.

Hyperagressive assholes just move closer. (Something about

You Ford vs Chevy people must live in the planet of Detroit or Droid.

Like they say in the airforce, with enough horsepower anything will fly.

I can put a 32valve V-8 with twin Garret-4s on Yugo and get 7.7sec QM.
Thats useless ... Its still a Yugo that will loose any race on a track,
or on the street.

Have you Detroit beings compared the ultra-long-throw stick shifts of
the 5.0 with the 93 MR2 turbo or 93 RX7 (I ll buy it in 6 mos) ?

Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of 
the 5.0 that sounds in every hairpin turn ?

And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...

Summary: Root, root, root for the Orioles...

I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would
help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the 
offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right
now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent
although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming
up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike
Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by
coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came
in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This
may be Ben's year. 
	I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will
be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year
around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need.
Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense
better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many
left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return
to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The 
rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an
interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get
three pop outs? You never know.
The way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in)
Baltimore
New York
Toronto
Milwaukee
Cleveland
Boston
Detroit
(The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. One of these 4 will
definitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :). I feel
that this Baltimore's season to finally put everything together.)

	I agree.  However, I have to object.  Growing up in the early
1980's and playing 2 years of Mario Mendoza-esque Little League, I was
told that since my hitting, well, sucked, I would do best to either
Walk, or take one in the face for the team.  I did both.  And, my
Yankee fan father would say, Bat like Oscar Gamble.  So I did.  And my
career OBP was about .550.
	Not only was Oscar a fun guy to watch, but he had some pretty 
cool baseball cards and helped me become one of the best little league
players in history.

There is a picture in the May 1993 edition of European Car (although,
it may not be on the shelf yet).

Some things that the article says:

	- prototype has front wheel drive (first front drive

	- wheelbase 3.15m
	- 7 seater
	- they claim that the price will be about the same as a
	  Renault Espace or Chrysler Voyager (DM 50,000)

Looking at the picture (slightly disguised) it looks like the Ford
Aerostar, to me.

I have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile. 
Such systems do exist, but none are presently installed in production autos
that I am aware of.  These are commonly called viscous drive CVTs or
fluidic amplifiers. 

>Contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered (result is no TQ mult)

What the convertor _does_ allow is for the engine to be closer to its
torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's
driveline.  Chevy proved it many years ago with the '70 Camaro (ETs and
terminal 1/4 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 4 speed and
auto cars).  Note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can
get away with fewer gears than a manual, the slip in the convertor makes up
for the fewer ratios (and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed
5 sspeed autos soon to be out, note that some manufacturers are using 6
speed manulas now). 

>Once past lauch however, the converter begins coupling and the TQ multiplication

Did anyone notice the words NOT FOR BASEBALL printed on the picture
of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA
Today? Any reason given for this?

Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in
the preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout.
On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the
last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan
pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of
publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as
most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are
both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing
and more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.

I doubt his trans uses standard syncros.  There are several mechanisms for

Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer
sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean.
Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left.
To do this, you have to push against something, and the only
thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well,
the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the 
ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to 
the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground 
pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  
The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing 
problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which
had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), 
but the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel 
toward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the 
wheel to turn to the right.  Hey, there we are.  No-hands counter-
steering.

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last
May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes
the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet
must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed
manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my
truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts
rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet 
says that the noise is a characteristic of the transmission.

Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the
gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about
55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,
the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should
point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a
detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They
dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for engine longevity
reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.
Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times 
so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being
shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between
stabilizer and control arm fell off).

Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What
really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt
to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for 
them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new
Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never
buy another Chevrolet.

  The funny thing about the digital dash (87 T-bird) with the 85mph speedo 
limit was that if you pressed the button to convert to kilometers it would 
read all the way up to 187kph.  At this point the stock anemic 302 would get 
short of breath.  This of course was equivalent to about 116mph (hehe).I bet 
I really coulda confused this thing if I'd toyed with the engine and rolled
the stupid thing (the digits were limited to 199). 

  I've gotta agree with ya on the analog clock w/digital dash though.  My
girlfriend had a '85 TurboCoupe with a digital clock and analog gauges/radio.
Go figure...

I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers,
notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at
the Stick.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was 
very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even
compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if
Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb.
McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball.
So on & so forth.

I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before
people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year.

 It has some of the most impressive performance figures around, and automotive

Maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make,
and award a balk if he exceeds it.  I'd have another question:  who would 
operate the pitch clock?  One of the umpires?  Add another one to the crew?

>Another pair of suggestions:

I'm not sure I like this idea.  I think it would severely diminish the 
number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic
ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).

>2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)

Ahhh!  I suppose I should read the whole article before I hit the 'f' key,
eh?  Obviously, from what I wrote above, I like this idea.

>The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows
>the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base.

It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the 
pitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner,
so he may hurry too much.  I'd rather see runs scored as the result of 
sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness
that could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are some
disadvantages to that idea too.

I remember in little league, if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter's
box, even for a moment, we were automatically out.  That may be a little 
harsh for the majors, but seriously, how about putting a limit on the 
batters being able to step out, take several dozen practice swings, pound
their shoes, scratch their balls, etc.?  Maybe forcing them to stay in the
batter's box wouldn't be such a bad idea.  That could save a few minutes.

I tell you, Steve Stone is like a prophet.
He must be making a ton in the boradcoast booth because
I can't understand why he's not actually back in the game itself.

The other day he called Sosa's homerun against the Sox and
claimed the game would be going into extra innings when the
score was 8-3 in the 5th.

So yesterday he notices that Sosa's ahead in the count against
Maddux and says, This is a fastball situation and Sosa will be
looking for it.  But this is also the spot where Maddux throws
the straight change.   Sure enough. Sosa gets ahead on it and pops
it up to the infield.

Stoney for Cubs manager!

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on
my 90 Prelude. See rec.autos.tech for more detail. My problem is a false
engagement point below the actual one. It also seems affected by weather -
it is most noticeable (and annoying) on damp or cold days. My dealer says
he can't reproduce the problem - I think I'll just sell the car.

True.  William Dummy Hoy was baseball's first deaf player.  He
played in the bigs from 1888 through 1903 for several teams, including

I couldn't agree more.  The Jays have a lot of power in their line-up. 
So far pitching has been the biggest problem.  Maybe we can get Acker back? :-)

>But anyway the point of my post, if you missed it, was that Derek Bell was

One incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on
to the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were
back in the clubhouse.  Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air,
waving a big towel over his head.  He looked like a big jerk, especially
when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole
season.  The next day, Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's
Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started.  The stadium
announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's
jeep.  Bell really freaked out. I don't think Bell was to popular after that.

I think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right now.  He's known
for being a great outfielder,  and he's not the only Blue Jay who has been
booting balls and playing generally awful.

I remember this happening on the I-75 through Michigan and Ohio several
years back. A group of guys in an old beater would rear end a car,
usually out of state or Canadians. You stop and they smack you with a BB
bat. At least they didn't kill you for the sake of a car.
I think the cops put out decoys and this calmed down for a while.

Vlasis, are you safe walking through Germany if you are a refugee ?

They changed the lights and slope of the hood, along with the new
grille.  Otherwise, it is unchanged.

Interestingly, their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a BIG
design statement... they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve
their own niche ... unfortunately, sales were only half those of the
LEXUS and hence, they now join the pack.  I still wonder if much of
the problem wasn't the slow start from the initial AD campaign.

Personally, I like the Q without the Grille.

This technique is employed by police to help establish guilt, especially when (9 times out of 10) he/she is not sure who was doing the speeding.

Summary: Dave Winfield was a marginal ballplayer.  Yeah, right.

	Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had
negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,
now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent
hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,
he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't 
know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are
similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,
he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his
OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)
was a absolute-primo-dick.  
	Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that
MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the
MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  
	Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s
solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks 
(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been 
a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  
	You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,
simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you 
blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)
Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, 
the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should 
HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.
	Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like
Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.

	Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?

>shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.
>Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so
>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something

	Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the
position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along
the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a 
good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more
recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early
80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's
offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his
career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer
:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.
	Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real
stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,
and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as
SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.

>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?

	Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a mediot 
candidate, pushed because of his winning attitude (a minor factor, if one
at all), and his great defense (no errors, admittedly, but the range of
a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.
	SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last
year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk
about Morris' ability to win which is nothing more than Morris' ability
to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs.  At this point, Morris is an
average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned 
close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the
80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year
for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but
not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF
consideration.  
	Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will
throw back your earlier logic about Yount and Smith being shortstops who 
hung around a long time.  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's 
just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...
(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)
	Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few
more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most
likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much
regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY 
tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and
legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the
league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the
end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.

	This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it 
or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off
the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably
left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE
who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these
are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]

Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands)
Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?)
Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities)
Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier)
New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot)
Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)

Kansas City: George Brett (lock)
Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock)
Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot)
Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]

Cubs: Sandberg (lock)
St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably)
New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain
				  	      past form)
[And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]

Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots.
San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot)
Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)

	[Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's
probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include
Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco,
McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before
1985)]

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in
a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two
home runs).  Or do they?  What is equivalent average?

One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took
away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for
doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you
expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, 
hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his
value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.

Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.
I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.
Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.

I'd put him about there too.  

Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he
was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so 
at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't
winning.

Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a
mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)
with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).

We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major
and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.
Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;
the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent
the player has left college ball, etc.

Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of error.  Sometimes
a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.
Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe
McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are
real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)
involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting
and so on.

But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.
One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background
of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is
that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing
ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.

What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player
with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a
Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so
on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard
assumptions fit this person slowly?

It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.
(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after
all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.
Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers, they say.  Well,
what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?
It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than
Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in
Atlanta than Greenville.  

Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank
this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's 
worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are 
other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties 
again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.
It's got some error.

Oh well.

OH yes they do! but considering i never wash my BMW (unless i need

altho the best scar (now faded) was from the exhaust piper,
while try to change the oil, after overheating the engine (watch
out for idiot drivers that won't let you pass in the mountains
when you have a rider, case of oil (it was on sale), and case of 
beer), with a drain bolt that decided to seize.

just how does everyone else clean out the area under the transmission
on a BMW R bike? they only way i have found is to remove the
engine and transmission. that and the clutch arm are impossible to
clean (which is wear one of the EC (s&m) are located).

Good question.  It's my impression, not backed by evidence, that general

Back in the 20's there were some attempts to hire black Cuban ballplayers;

Well, what *did* I mean to say?  Aside from some short-lived exceptions
such as Japanese internment in WW II, only blacks were affected by laws
regarding: slavery, Jim Crow, miscegenation, military service, etc.  If
my claim of exclusivity is not 100% airtight, that is, if you can come
up with this or that exception, fine -- have a cookie.  But compared to
this list, no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth

What's the problem here?  Back in 1958 I rode a Puch 175 from Paris to
Barcelona and back.  That was a two stroke, and back then it was representative
of the size of bikes on the road.  A 350 was considered a big bike, and the
superbikes of the day were 500cc or 600cc.  Anything bigger was real rare.

Shaz,

Hmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way:
  There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.
  initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
  your car. The computer will actually sense how you drive your car and
  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
  on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.
  
  After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the
  computer starts counting again.

So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will 
come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.

I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
indicator.

It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a 
surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happen
since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil and
not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.

Any BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed.

PS.  my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW

These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. It

If you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:

  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?

Do you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn
will run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your

I'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? I've been
doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got
over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a
transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?

On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so
worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.
To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where
harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother
quicker & easier they where to shift.

My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently
wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window,
I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless
shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some
times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5.

this is off the subject but, 

Don't the numbers in the car names above refair to the engine size in

and Q45 = 4.5liter.. (similar, kinda, to BMW and MB nameing deal).

MK48T02 from thomsom.  It has a timekeeper (clock) and 512 bytes of NVRAM which
has a lithium battery backup.  The battery has a life of ~10 years of poweroff
operation.  Installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not
draw much current.  The battery would only be used when your auto battery was
dead or had been removed.

In California they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which states
that the odometer mileage is correct.  If incorrect you are required to 
fill in what you know (or guesstimate) to be the correct mileage.  If you
lie on this form and are caught you can be prosecuted and the buyer can
sue you for the value of the mileage differential.

My last car had T-Tops (BIG T-Tops).  My current car is a convertible.
IMHO, if you're after that 'convertible feel', T-Tops, open-top,
sunroofs, moonroofs, whatever, just don't cut it.  There's no
substitute for a convertible.  If you're not after that sun beating
down on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum and
jetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the
whooshing of the wind, you're not after that 'convertible feel'.
So go with something with at least a hole above the driver but don't call
it a convertible.

And I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll
bar in a rollover situation.  Of course, I'd rather not test it
in MY car.  I, too, am in my early 40s.

A convertible--accept no substitute.

Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is
based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you

OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please
answer yes or no, Roger:
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?
AL only, please.

For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact
that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,
hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a
rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,
for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.
So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other
things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238
for Boston), the Red Jays would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or
enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but
that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that had Morris
performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.

Pags and Terry Jorgenson will platoon at third, with Reboulet as the
backup infielder.  Pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who
lead the league in DA in 1991, muffing what should be routine grounders
(heck, muffing a grounder *I* would probably have gotten to).  Jorgenson
did nothing exceptional that I noticed.  Leius missed a ball I *think*
Gagne would have reached; we will certainly miss Gag's glove this season.

He looked pretty good there.  Contrary to what the mediots have been saying,
he looked reasonable at first.  He isn't mid-80s Hrbek, but then neither is
the Pretty Big Guy himself any more (note:  I'm used to seeing the Twins
1B looking kinda big on the field, but not that big!).  If he hits vaguely
like last year, he's a perfectly good first baseman.

Note:  Much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game
where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings.  Winfield may
have big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up (he didn't have to
pick any bad throws, for example), but I'll take what I saw so far.

Just a quick note on the nwe shape MR2s in the UK.... 

When they first came out here, there were 3 models. The base model had an 
auto box and engine from the CAMRY 2.0 !!! Well I recentyl found out that this 
model is no longer profitable for Toyota and have since scraped it. I've also
noticed that auto MR2s have depreciated a lot more than the next model up...

I don't think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing
to pay the price.  I'm sure someone out there in net-land has some
facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity
sold.  But even if the trends are relatively flat, you have to consider
what is happening on a team-by-team basis.

When the TV money dries up, franchises will be seeking to supplant the
lost revenues from alternative sources.  One of the best sources may
be ticket sales.

Example 1:	The Dodgers

	The Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales
	and *probably* believe that they have the ability to raise
	prices without hindering revenues.  I certainly think that is
	true.

Example 2:	The Padres

	They will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year.
	If they raise prices, less.  If they want to increase their
	overall revenue base, the best thing they can do is put a
	winning team on the field.  But given that won't happen (it
	won't), they can probably make more money by lowering ticket
	prices and running frequent promotions.  Will they do that?
	I have no idea.  But they won't increase prices, because it
	won't work *for them*.


>2) even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners
>   decrease ticket prices, that does not decrease the tv contract.


The only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place.
Each team's market is somewhat different, and each owner is going to
be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those
market forces.  As a buiness manager, I would never *want* to lower my
prices, but sometimes that strategy is necessary, and sometimes it works.
You have to consider everything if you want continued success.

Hey folks,

Saw the Giants play ball at the 'Stick Saturday, April 17.  It was the game
where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,
two-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn't the game where the fans 
threw the give-away fotoballs onto the field in response to the homer --
too bad, huh?)

Well, the 'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it
was cold then.  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick.  The
wind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.

At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on
the field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed
mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run
out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths
the infield) and grab the trash.

It might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given
anything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins here!

Whaddaya think?

all of my HO's disagree with your HO's.  I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick..
detested it in the auto(like i did any other time in the auto...).  Of course,
Dalls rush hours are nothing, from what i hear..if i lived in LA, i might
be of a different persuasion.  And, just for the record, rarely do you shift
gears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th is
good up through around 80-90, most of the time, so you can just wind it out..
it's not going to hurt anything, and keeps it in the powerband anyway..
only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th(fairly rare,
unless you drive a ferrari or some such, i'd bet) or when you hit cruising 
speed where you feel comfortable(or when my mother is sitting in the 
passanger seat complaining about how you wind her poor little engine way
too hi :-)
Just my HO's..

Well, my driveway is... Just keep an eye out for the blue GLH Turbo that 
utilizes the hit-the-ground-running merging technique. 
At least I don't have a dog that you need worry about.

Last week while entering a sand/gravel covered intersection in the country, 
I caught something unkosher out of the corner of my eye (you know that 
disgusting sensation when great, as-of-yet unidentified, evil is about to 
intimately acquaint itself with you-- kind of like knowing that that darkening 
shadow around you just cannot possibly be anything even remotely good, because
it probably has something to do with a Boeing 747 behaving, gravitationally
speaking, much like a brick).  Negotiating my way into this intersection that 
somehow reminded me of Daytona beach (sans H2O, sun, & babes) I manage to get a
glance at my impending destiny.  Lucifer's own DOG.  Hell's secret blend
of canine-- Doberman and Rottweiler (it moved with the grace of a Doberman,
yet had the hulk and jowels of the Rottweiler-- a creature with a definite
*wrong* end to be at).  The picture in my mirrors was fuzzy, but there was no 
mistaking the fangs and saliva trail.  
To shorten a verbose tale, my burly gaurdian-angels once again performed above
and beyond the call of duty, carried the bike through the sand-trap (I honestlyhave no idea how), and left the minion of Beelzebub with a face that 
suspiciously resembles a Metzler tread.  No blood, though-- Rats.

Moral: I'm not really sure, but more and more I believe that bikers ought 
       to be allowed to carry handguns.

Okay, okay, I know the Ford Probe is made in the US, in fact it's
made in Michigan, at a Mazda plant.  My question: are most of the parts
from American or Japanese sources?  I have been told that most of the US
assembly plants for Japanese automakers import almost all of the parts used in
the vehicles.

Any information anyone has on this will be appreciated!

Never had any problem with mine...

Are you *SURE* the nut/bolt you are trying is really a 1/2 hex?  13mm
is just slightly larger...  and a 1/2 wrench won't fit on a GM 13mm
nut (my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it...  really annoying, metric
threads too.  Seems that most of the body is metric, most of the engine is
SAE).

	My neighbor runs a Viper(R) distributorship and installs them on all
Saturns sold in my area (Anne Arundel County, MD).  He has an SC with the
Viper voice alarm installed.  The alarm does everything, turn on the car, 
the radio, the heater, roll down windows, unlock the doors...  The alarm goes
off more frequently on hot days when a person walks by.  It gets sensitive up
to about 5 feet in 85degree heat.  It isn't as bad as convetional siren alarms,
because it doesn't continue to wail, it just says Protected by Viper, please
stand back!  And shuts up...  (mainly because the person walks away 
befuddled!!!)

That's absurd! That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor
of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument
for lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgument
in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to 
which the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous,
there wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do; therefore it is
a non-seqitur.

Also, even though most people do not ride motorcycles, they do boat, sail,
jetski, climb, ski, fly parachute, hang-glide, glide, bungee-jump, bike,
skate, rollerblade, skateboard, play rugby (ouch), mow the lawn, rewire
the basement, operate heavy machinery,  and do a host of other 'dangerous'
things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban.
Your little homily applies to all those things, and the general public
buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity
would be next is unlikely.

Two shots at it: (1) Check the tires again - if you can see the wear bars,
you're down to problem area (and some tires pass a penny test between the
bars - that's no guide at all). Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.
You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the
tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.

(2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put
them thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as
soft ones. Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very
often, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reason
they are considered cleaner is because they are better at the emissions we
actually measure and regulate.  But they also contribute additional emissions
which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or
limits have been defined.  

Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions
and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  Diesel particulates
are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emit
signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidence
is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may
have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.

And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in
rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels is
awful and it can even burn the eyes.  

Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.

Automatic revocation of your license for a year.  I'm not sure it's the
toughtest law around, but NC has absolutely no sense of humor with
respect to driving laws, anyway.  I think they put you in jail and sell
your first child into slavery for passing a school bus...

A bill breezed through the NC House to lower the intoxification level
from .1 to .08.  It faces stiff opposition in the Senate.  Recently,
the Highway Patrol took a few of the opposition Senators out and gave
them some shots, and when they hit .07, put them on a course dodging
cones.  They failed, and will probably change their votes as a result.

For some bizarre reason, NC is the only state where the governer has no
veto power over legislation coming out of the state Congress, so his
opinion on the matter is moot.

Hey!  What's this?  We agree!

No platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel).

Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters,
	and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with
	slow curves and change ups.

Sabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye.  Samuel
	is noted as an agressive free-swinger.  Sabo has more homerun power.

Both players started the game hitting below .200.  

There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted
	Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later.  But the game
	*was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in.

Given all of this, I don't see a lot to suggest pinch-hitting, nor do
I see anything to suggest no pinch-hitting.  There is, of course, the
clutch-hitting information.  But if that's useless...

Then again.  If it's not...

One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't
yet been addressed.  I believe the rule also does *not* deal with this
situation:

If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up
and advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.

However, if the Infield Fly is *not* caught, at what point can a
runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for
advancing too early?  When the
ball hits the ground?  When a fielder first touches the ball after it
hits the ground?

Enlightenment would be appreciated.

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live. 
If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to
get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your
vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any
thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:

1)	ignition kill or fuel cut-off
2)	a flashing red LED

These two are basic to a decent alarm system.  
To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock.
That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target.
But, then there's always car-jacking.  
Why is life so confusing?
I hope I helped somewhat.

Greetings:

Can someone steer me towards sources of information on vehicle data
logging systems?  In  particular, I would like to build/buy (or a little
of both) a system that is small enough to fit on a motorcycle and will
take input from various sensors (pressure, LVDT's, acceleration, RPM,
O2 sensor...), digitize and record it for later analysis.  

Please email me any info.  If I get anything interesting, I'll compile
it and get it on the net.  Thanks.

I remember seeing an artical on large-engine oil 
requirements, and one of the ways of prolonging
the life of the oil was to run through a heated
un-presurized chamber to allow water and volitiles
to boil off. This made such long-term usage of 
oil practical.

If you had been looking in your mirror, you would have seen the guy coming 
before you heard the screeching tires.

When you're stopped at a light:

1)  Stop so that you're got space in front of you, and a quick easy escape
route (between lanes, into a crosswalk, up a driveway, somewhere) if someone
decides they want to plow into you.

2)  Keep the bike in first with the clutch in until at least a couple of cars
are stopped behind you, so you don't have to waste a second you don't have
trying to get it in gear if you need to move.

3)  Watch your mirrors.  In that situation, most of the hazards you are 
trying to avoid are coming from behind you.  SIPDE (<-- msf-geek-speak)
isn't just for when you're moving.  And you're less likely to panic and stall
the bike if you've got time to prepare before the guy's tires lock up behind
you.  (You still get the bejeezus scared out of you, but it's more a feeling
of quickly-rising dread than a sudden jolt.)

I didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like
McGwire, Bonds, and Frank Thomas was rational.  
I just said that it exists.

I don't know Alex Cole's batting style at all.   Some questions:
How tall is he?
Does he go into a crouch like Rickey Hederson/Pete Rose?
Does he foul off a lot of pitches like Brett Butler?
Does he take 1 or 2 strikes in each at bat?

It could be the Cole has a good batting eye.
Look above, I said that *many* high OBP guys draw their walks because
pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them, not all high OBP guys.

Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,
with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.
My opinion, FWIW, to all:

Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried
rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven
himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays
better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent
minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las
Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major
league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's
numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have
the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.

That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to
start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league
season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very
poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill
are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,
they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around
.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on
the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was
just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at
any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

On a similar note, I don't understand why more people are not
supportive of Neon Deion. Granted, I thought his behavior with
McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time
he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he
has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more
valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),
had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,
EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF
(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the
potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15
best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching
his prime season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate
prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

In my opinion, the limited tort option is the best thing Casey has ever
done. Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue
for pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:
1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is
some number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)

2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver
was drunk)

3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal
to regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever
happening).

You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can
still sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited
tort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who
treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. In
exchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save
$150/year.

Unfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse
people so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort.
I guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurance
companies would be pushing harder for repeal.

Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.

I am in the process of looking for a half decent aftermarket sport exhaust
for my 1981 BMW 320i. So far, I have found a Pacesetter exhaust for $219
and an Ansa exhaust for $190 (Canadian funds). I was wondering if anyone
could tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possible
exhausts that I may be interested in. My main priorities are a decent horse
power increase (5-30%) and a nice low note to go along with that added power.
I was also thinking of looking into both Remus and Leistritz exhausts.Has 
anyone got anything to say about these? I am mainly looking for the muffler
only but if anyone can find a good deal on a whole kit I would be willing to
go after that. I also would like to know how much these would cost me in the 
States.Please mail me back if you have any information.

'63 to '82 vettes had the same basic chassis. 1980 add aluminum (weaker)

My origional inquires to my insurance agent: I can drive my '69 convertable

Get an appraiser to look at the car. He will check serial numbers and look 
for origional equipe.  Depending on what mods have been done the car could 
be worth only 10K.  Problems like wrong engine / trans.  Wrong paint type (
vetts used lacquer)  An modification would reduce tthe value.  But your 
looking for a car to drive right?

This sounds like a ball park price for a small-block (327 cu in.) / manual 
/ no air car.  A 427 would put it closer to $30K.

Get it appraised!!!  For insurance purposes also.

Well my last two motorcycles have been shaft driven and they will wheelie.
The rear gear does climb the ring gear and lift the rear which gives an

Yes, but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot.

all they have to do is reach underneath, turn a valve, and forget the trip 
home.
But there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them.

I personally recommend, installing a 'special' locking drain plug to keep

Makes sense to me, after all when steel is manufactured and stored they
put oil on it so it won't rust. Logicaly, when you store your bike, you

Any advice on HOW to buy a Land Cruiser? My local Toyota dealer says they
get two a year, and if I want one I can just get on the waiting list.
Forget about a test drive or even kicking the tires.
And if they are that rare, I doubt there is much of a parts inventory on
hand.

I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually _fits_.
HG makes the v-pilot jackets, mine is a very similar style made
by Just Leather in San Jose. I bought one of the last two they
ever made.

Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  There is a lot
of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere, made of fashion leather,
made to fit men, etc.  I don't know of a shop in your area.  There
are some women rider friendly places in the San Francisco/San Jose
area, but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  Too hard
to tell if it'll fit.  Bates custom makes leathers.  You might want
to call them (they're in L.A.) and get a cost estimate for the type
of jacket your wife is interested in.  Large manufacturers like
BMW and H.G. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality, but
fit is iffy.

A while ago, Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting
a business doing just this sort of thing.  Don't know what they
finally decided.

Sure, like Ron Gant wasn't completely out of line.

If I were Hirschbeck, I would have ejected, in order, Ron Gant, every single

language he used.  Since Cox was the only Brave rung up, I suspect I would
have thrown him out too.

You simply cannot show up an umpire like Ron Gant did.  It is disrespectful
of not only the home plate umpire, but of the dignity of the game.

Educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year.
Lankford injured himself in a previous game and Torre was resting
him.

As far as the Whitten/Gilkey controversy.  Whitten adds some more
needed power, and if Jordan continues to hit the way he has been,
Gilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough.

There are very few disciplines where 100% certainty is necessary to
state something as fact.  Baseball is not one of them.

Therefore I can say that I know Clemens was better than Morris last
year, and Larkin was better than Griffin.  No, I can't ascertain this.
I can't prove it.  But I'm not required to do so.

And since you obviously feel that such threads are meaningless,
why don't you simply stay out of them?

I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs. But did the Hurt
study make any distinction between an *ability* to swerve and a *failure*
to swerve? In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen, riders
will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare, simply because
the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rides
everything else. Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive
manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable?

This is really the only thing we disagree on. Maybe we should agree to

Jeez, Ed, when you started talking about traction management policies I
thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway
locomotives...

The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the
front brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being
that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In
practice I suspect most people do what you describe.

If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've
achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always
aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the
limits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. 

In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep
both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing
exactly as *you* suggest!!

The problem with your nihilistic approach, Roger, is that it takes all the
sense out of the game.  By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a
double play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in saying
that that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating
on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double
play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was
eventually won or lost for unknown reasons.  After all, any speculation
involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't.

Roger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the
ceiling instead?  Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence?

Teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else
in their division.  If they don't make the post-season, they don't win the
Series.  Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate
goal in ring-collecting?

If so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal
towards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider
how to win games.

In your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that
cannot be analyzed.  While many of us are thinking things like Base-
runners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than
double plays with the bases loaded, you are thinking things like
It's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious
team dynamics that will cause the team to win today.

The result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual
players.  Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left
field.  After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would
have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt
it.  Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player.  Did Dave Winfield
have anything to do with the Jays' victory?  Probably, but how do you know?
If you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won,
perhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to Alpha
Centauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed
in mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto).

Was Babe Ruth a good player?  He played on some WS-winning teams, but did
he have anything to do with their success?

It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, and
Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't.  It seems to me that anybody who
would deny this needs to provide the proof.

Now, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically
and by looking at the rulebook.  It is necessary to score more runs than
one's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs
and to prevent one's opponent from scoring.  Runs are scored while a team
is batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that
making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good.  Players have tendencies
to hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent
from year to year.

We do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you.  To make
some flat predictions:  Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than
Gene Larkin this year.  The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies
in the standings.  The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but
will also give up more.  I would be astonished if any of these turned
out to be false, and, I suspect, so would you.  As a matter of fact, I
am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given
3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random
chance (and almost statistically significant).

If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in
the World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure
likelihoods, however fuzzy.

So how about real life?  Person A robs a service station with two people
in it, using a .38 automatic pistol, gets $42, and is convicted and sentenced
for three years.  Person B, with a similar criminal record, robs a service
station with two people in it, using a .38 revolver, gets $42, and is
convicted.  Since they used two different types of handgun, are comparisons
totally meaningless?

Say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are always
testing this - they don't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time).  You
have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before, so
all previous evidence is meaningless?  Or would you be surprised if it flew
out the window instead of hitting the desk?

Now, while I wouldn't recommend doing this while moving,

(Maybe Mike Beaverton can complain to you awhile! :/ )

you might not want to countersteer if you're just sitting

I have a line on a Ducati 900GTS 1978 model with 17k on the clock.  Runs
very well, paint is the bronze/brown/orange faded out, leaks a bit of oil
and pops out of 1st with hard accel.  The shop will fix trans and oil 
leak.  They sold the bike to the 1 and only owner.  They want $3495, and
I am thinking more like $3K.  Any opinions out there?  Please email me.
Thanks.  It would be a nice stable mate to the Beemer.  Then I'll get
a jap bike and call myself Axis Motors!

	Agreed, but, yes, chapstick fits under the waxy shit category,
although I've noticed that stealing Annette's chapstick (after she's

I read that GM wants to keep the Design part of Lotus but lose the car
production. And, I seem to remember, that the main problem with the Elan
was caused by GM's insistence that the Elan be re-designed (significantly)
for the US market which caused major design & production headaches.

anyone else experiencing a similar problem?

This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch
is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there
is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  Then the
clutch shifts smoothly.  This chatter started when I moved to the San 
Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.  The dealer stated
that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to
non-asbestos clutch material.  No remedy!! Seems that moisture on clutch
surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates.

Any comments out there?

So let's see what we have on the Batdude so far: He has a weird helmet.
He drags his knee in corners (thanks, Cookson, but how does he do it?
Hidden Bat-pucks?), and he only takes the bike out in the snow or rain.
Also, he lets Robin ride! I think I could have used a Bat-mom. Would
have made getting my license a lot easier!

There's a trend here: Stylish helmet, Stylish knee-dragging, rides only
in Stylish cartoon precipitation. Hmm . . . Could it be that we're
dealing with a veritable airborne mammalian poseur? Dare I say it, a
BAT-SQUID?? (huh? Bat-Squid?) It all adds up now . . .

Let's make the B-man an honorary DoD DuDe. All he needs is a DoD

Actually, anyone have an address for Batman's current artists, both
comic book and animated series? We'll write and ask if Batman would like
to become an honorary Denizen! Yeah!

Blue Jays? No way hell, but the yankees probably do. Remember, the Yankees  
had the best record of any team in the 80's, and probably take the 20's  
through 60's as well.

assuming yours is a non turbo MR2, the gruffness is characteristic of
a large inline 4 that doesn't have balance shafts.  i guess toyota
didn't care about little details like that when they can brag about
the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling.

myself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration (or
recommendation) which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no
balance shafts..  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you
ever want a halfway decent engine.  

if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do
except to sell it and get a V6.

This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience'. For  
crying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers  
this way and still stay in business? Again, I don't expect sales people to  
bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be  
abused either. I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to  
me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales  
cubicles. Evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue  
to do business this way. There must be a lot of people out there who are  
easy to intimidate.

On the other hand, I'm not sure about the 'one price, no haggling'  
approach that Saturn and other are starting to use. I guess if their fixed  
price is fair it's OK. Maybe the best approach is to do your homework  
before you go in. Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable  
profit for the dealer ($200-$300??), offer them that price and stick to  
it. If they get abusive, just leave. Then, don't let them try to screw you  
after the deal is agreed on.

I knew when I posted that I was going to get into trouble. Now I suppose I
have to give /5 wheelie demos at the Spring Fling or something.

But you're right, John, it is a chain drive model. I think it goes around
the camshaft and up over the rocker arms or something. Stolen from an early
Spagthorpe design, according to urban legend.

  Can you beat this ticket?  Personally, I think it's your Duty As a Citizen
to make it as much trouble as possible for them, so maybe they'll Give Up
and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon.
  The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing
your speed.  Mr. Brown (the author of Fight Your Ticket) mentions an
Oakland judge who convicted a speeder on the officer's testimony that
the driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed.
  You can pay off the State and your insurance company, or you can
take it to court and be creative.  Personally, I've never won that way
or seen anyone win, but the judge always listens politely.  And I haven't
seen _that_ many attempts.
  You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the
cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing, they therefore
appear to be further away, and so their speed appears to be greater than
it actually is.  I left out a step or two, but you get the idea.  If you
can make it convincing, theoretically you're supposed to win.
  I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken.  I did get to see
some other poor biker try it.  He was mixing up various facts like
the maximum acceleration of a (cop) car, and the distance at which
the cop had been pacing him, and end up demonstrating that he couldn't
possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested.  He'd
brought diagrams and a calculator.  He was Prepared.  He lost.  Keep
in mind cops do this all the time, and their word is better than yours.
Maybe, though, they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time.
Besides, this guy didn't speak English very well, and ended up absolutely
confounding the judge, the cop, and everyone else in the room who'd been
recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota.
  Ahem.  OK, I'm better now.  Maybe he'd have won had his presentation
been more polished.  Maybe not.  He did get applause.

the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a
large enough portion of the population, and have suggested various
remedies, such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that
smoke'embake'emdominatebysheerintimidation is an accurate description
of what is, essentially, a laid-back game.

forget those lame ideas.  here is my new and exciting two-point plan to
generate interest in baseball among the masses.

point one: sex.
point two: violence.

let's face it, sex and violence are the only things that sell in
america.  here's how we can implement them in the game:

sex: cheerleaders, cheerleaders, and more cheerleaders.  dancing on top
     of the dugouts.  bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh
     inning stretch.  running up and down the stands.  (the south bend
     white sox actually do this).

violence: baseball players are such utter wuss boys.  the pitcher beans
     the batter, and both benches empty in what is called a bench-clearing
     brawl.  EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER. stand,
     stand, stand.  look, look, look.  ho, hum.  then, the bullpens
     come running in.  when they reach the fight, they just stand
     there, too.

     anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch
     should be suspended and fined.  further, the bullpens should fight
     it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running
     to the infield.

football: sex, violence.
basketball: sex, violence.
hockey: violence.
baseball: da pastime of da nayshun! - yawn.

On the other side of the fence, I owned a Bieffe off-road helmet.
Took what I would consider a minor fall, and had visible damage
to the shell.  Yes, the helmet did its job.  But the damage/impact
ratio was scary.  I own Bell Moto-5 now, have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact (we do this frequently in MX),
and don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons.  My
recommendation is to buy _high_ quality gear.  YMMV.

I bought a car with a defunct engine, to use for parts
for my old but still running version of the same car.

The car I bought has good tires.

Is there anything in particular that I should do to
store the defunct car long-term?  I'd hate to have
parts of it go bad.  Someone has told me it's bad
for the tires to not move the car once-in-a-while.
Is this true?   Do I need some props to take the
weight of the tires?

Yeah, People act really shocked about violence, as though it were new
to our species...

What about the holocaust? The crusades? The Salem witch trials? The
religious persecutions of the middle-ages? 

What about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over
the world? What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans?
The Jews persecuted by Christians?

There are a lot more humans today than there have ever been. I do not
know the stats, but there are far more people on the planet than there
were 2 or 3 hundred years ago! The per capita acts of violence are
probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a
thousand years ago!

There is nothing new about violence.

Actually, I could care less what his salary is.  It has something to do
with the fact that we live in America, and everyone is entitled to
whatever he can legally obtain.  If Sandy Alderson and the Haas family
willingly negotiate a salary of $35 million per year with Rickey, I couldn't
care less.

But what REALLY GETS MY GOAT is the bullshit he spouted in spring training,
about `Well... sometimes I may not play as hard, or might be hurt more
often, in a place where I'm not appreciated'.  This quote was in the Chronicle
about the second week of camp, and strongly suggests that he was going to 
dog it all year if the ownership didn't kiss his butt and ante up some
more money.  For God's sake, Rickey, you signed a contract 4 years ago,
now honor it and play!  

Say all you want to about Steve Garvey, and believe
me, I hated him too, but at least when he put his signature on a piece
of paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up.

I don't know where you live, but I couldn't get out of my driveway
at night without reverse lights. As someone said, out in the country
you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between
day and night. At night around my house (which is amongst a forest of
rather tall oaks) it is DARK, except for nights with full moons.
Reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up; I greatly
prefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights.

I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of
things impressed me.  

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer
atmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Field
in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and
bundled up fans.  

The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!
I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.
It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the
AFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,
but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with
a lot of baseball fans in other cities.  

Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion
teams bring back some excitement.  We'll find out Friday how Denver
Bronco fans respond. 

Phillies are 2-0! (I better say it now before my opportunity passes
by)

Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most 
instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more 
performance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.
The mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at 
2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of 
the slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose
to but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...
Anyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,
which is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario 
slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full 
throttle.

Just remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or
exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may
have to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust
system, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point
which re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping
profile.

Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if
they have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the
system also to see what they think about there slip on.

Also, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on a
group of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a 
side bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at
the rear wheel, 85 verses 91. 

Buyer beware, of outrageous claimed increases in horse power! It may have been 
true in the past, but not today!

usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
him/her/it may mean that something is wrong.

The two problems I'd see with your strategy is that the red light may
change before you can get anything meaningful out of your mouth, or the
occupant(s) may take exception to your opinions and demonstrate such
physically (on you or your now-parked bike). Admittedly, the latter is a
slim chance, but it would be enough to give me pause.

Herein lies the key to this thread:

Kindly note the difference in the responses.  Ed (and I) are talking
about knowing riding technique, while Mike is arguing knowing the physics
behind it.  It *is* possible to be taught the technique of countersteering
(ie: push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way) *without*
having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones
and such as seen in the parallel thread.  That stuff is mainly of interest
to techno-motorcycle geeks like the readers of rec.motorcycles  ;^),
but doesn't need to be taught to the average student learning c-steering.
Mike doesn't seem to be able to make the distinction.  I know people
who can carve circles around me who couldn't tell you who Newton was.
On the other hand, I know very intelligent, well-educated people who
think that you steer a motorcycle by either: 1) leaning, 2) steering
a la bicycles, or 3) a combination of 1 and 2.  Knowledge of physics
doesn't get you squat - knowledge of technique does!

Right. In the thirties both Buick and Packard had two spares mounted in
wells in the front fenders. Of course that was back when the front
fenders were long enough to provide room. There were a couple of other
marques that did this as well, but memory fades.

Pretty much like the people who buy the Mazda MX-5 (Miata) today.  Small 
fun and you can fool yourself (and a lot of other people) that you have the 
performance of many far superior (and much more expensive) performnace cars.

If you don't already know it, you should call the bank/credit union/
finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the
current payoff cost.

If you are trading in your current car on the new car, subtract the
payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you.  (If this
turns out to be a negative number, you need to reconsider the deal.)
Subtract this difference from the price of the new car.  This is the
size of the loan you will need for the new car.

The dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out
of the money you give them when you pick up your new car.

At least that's how it worked for me 5 years ago in Ohio...

Japan is _much_ more open than Korea.

Yes.  A Pontiac Grand Am suffers a factor of _2_ increase in price
when it is exported to Japan.

However, a Dodge vehicle (the one that Congressman Gephardt mentioned)
suffers a factor of _4_ increase in price when it is exported to Korea.
A Ford Taurus suffers the same problem.  A Honda Accord costs--I am
not making this up--$48,000 in Korea.

Just how many people would want to buy a Honda Accord for $48,000?

Solution:  All ships carrying Korean-made vehicles should be returned
           to Seoul.  Pronto.  Until as such time as Korea decides
           that it wants to abide by the rules of free and fair trade
           with the USA and Japan.

For those that are interested I got my fully optioned (Air, ABS,
sunroof) '92 SE-R in September 1991 for $13,555 in Sacramento, CA. It
was one of the 1st '92s sold, few of the dealers had any, no local
dealer had an ABS equipped SE-R.  I went straight to the fleet manager
at the dealership I liked, told him what I wanted, made him aware that I
knew what his price should be.  He called me back with exactly what I
wanted from a dealer 125mi away, I took delivery the next day.

i think you got it the other way round: the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180
degree v12 and not a true boxer, while the subaru and porsche are
true boxers.  don't know about the vw bug though, but i suspect that
it is also a true boxer.

Did they ever put in any gas stations on US 12?  I rode through there in
1987, skipped a fillup at Bryce Canyon and rode 100+ miles before seeing
a gas station at Torrey.  Awesome road, I recall riding up a narrow ridge
above 9,000? 10,000? feet.

It seems that there are more and more bands available for
police radar each month.  I have recently purchased (within
the last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfect
detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.  

Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and
read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of
the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors
was touted as covering.  

So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all
the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the
new Super Ka wideband.  

Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing
increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for
the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is
now the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make sense
to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my new detector?
Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be 
worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the 
market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the
3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had
inadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simpler
when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best
equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously
shop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar 
bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.

Teflon, being a trade-name, should always by capitalized.

Assuming you're serious, I guess you'd be surprised to hear
that us GUYS don't think so. I would guess that a tiny fraction
of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of
doubt that even you agree with it.

I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because, 
after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.

I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the
AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex
discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.

>Jeez!  Look at Pam Postema.  Just because she's a woman, everybody on the

I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience
with her ability as an umpire.

But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be
that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the
umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems
to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees
the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her
either.

The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners
safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is
to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the
players from trying to kill each other. 

Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most
of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she
deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of
the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires
need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.

To follow-up, I had a bad experience w/ a Krypto Lock too...

Last year I bought a Krypto Cable II (3/8x3-4' long, something like that)
that by all standards seemed like a decent piece.  Until I used it anyway...
Before I ever used it for security purposes, I used it for entertainment
(minds out of the gutter, please), which is to say that I sat fiddling w/
it while watching TV (the night I got it).  After three minutes of mindless
fiddling (of course it was mindless, remember I was watching TV) the entire
tumbler mechanism came out on the key!  Not unlike that old Georgie-porgie
nursery rhyme.  This left a very empty cylinder and a very non-secure 
(read swingin' in the breeze) cable lock.
Kinda makes me wonder about any flat key-style lock.  One yank w/ a 
slide-hammer and Viola-- I'm making an insurance claim.

Anyone else have a similar experience (w/ the Kryptos, not bike theft)?

  It depreciates much faster, too.

----------
The '84 GL1200A hit the traps at 13.34 according to Cycle magazine. Yeah,
they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then
they bottom out. Got my '86 GL1200I w/ 2275 miles on the odometer for
just under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost
16K miles onnit....that's about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost.

Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure. 
If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere
$2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to
depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of
the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about
Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the
knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-) 

According to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is a
real dog when he pillions his 120lb wife. All that money for a dog that
doesn't defecate much. =:-]

2 simple reasons:

(1)   Batting Williams ahead of Bonds will create a Left(Clark), 
      Right(Williams), Left(Bonds) situation in the middle of the
      batting order.  This makes it tougher for opposing manager
      to change pitchers.

(2)   Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get
      more good pitches to hit.  This is important since he struggles
      so much with breaking balls.  Opposing pitchers don't want to
      walk Williams to get to Bonds.

Not any more the rules don't say that.  So that's a pretty dumb argument.

If I'm going to drive on a public road then I need a
speedometer, and an odometer helps for navigation.
 
My 1965 Chevy has a bare minimum:  Engine-temp and
Oil-press warning lights and a fuel gauge. 

My 1983 VW has tach, water-temp, voltmeter 
and oil-temp gauges. 
 
If I had a turbo car, I'd want a vacuum manifold/boost
gauge.  An oil pressure gauge is a nice, reassuring
gauge to look at.  If my car was air cooled, then I
would substitute a cyl-head-temp gauge for the water-temp
gauge.
 
A few years ago, I looked at the Audi Quattro Si Coupe
that Bobby Unser used to win the 1986 Pikes Peak Hill Climb.
The gauge layout, from left to right, top to bottom was:
 
----------------------------------

Hello,
	I am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 Honda
Civic Si.  I was wondering if anyone could suggest upgrades that were not
too drastic.  I thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a new
header.  Does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would give
me?  I think I would check with Jackson Racing for the part.  Are there
any other comparines would make Honda parts.  

	Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won't
screw up the car.  Things like new injectors?, new fuel injection chip etc?
I would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a
difference.

	I don't really want to change the cam etc because I have heard that it
would be much harder on the engine.

E-Mail relpies prefered please and I will post a summary of all the replies.
Thanks for any help you may have to offer!

Harry talks about this incident in his autobiography Holy Cow.  
Unfortunately, I can not clarify on this since (1) I read the book a couple
of years ago and (2) I do not have my book with me.  

Anyway, It is a pretty interesting book if you are a Harry or Cubs fan.

Look for a happier-looking KZ440?

Suzuki used to have an L designation, for example my former boss had a
GS850L which had a seat a couple inches lower than the regular
GS850, but it was certainly no cruiser.

Your Passat VR6 is designed to run on premium gasoline, however the
engine electronics will retard the timing so that no harm wil be done
to the engine with lower octane fuel.

You will likely, however, get somewhat more power and fuel mileage
(especially in hot weather) out of this particular engine if you do
run it on premium.

************************************************************

The Event:

* The Joliet Mud Turtles, a Chicago land four wheel drive club, is
  sponsoring an On/Off Road Rally Sunday April 25th.

* For those who ask What is an on/off road rally?, well...

  An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:

   1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of
      directions and clues guiding participates around the 
      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course
      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will
      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the
      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately 
      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is 
      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points
      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions
      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,
      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.

   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants
      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.
      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles
      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half
      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle
      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will
      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified
      4x4s can run the course.
     
  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring
  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.
  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.

* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles
  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be
  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section
  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper
  from their vehicle :) .

The Particulars:

* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.
    (815)436-9382   (see map below)
* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.
* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine
* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.
* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)
* A valid drivers license is required
* Suggested equipment:
      CB Radio
      Compass
      Tow Strap and Clevis
      Clip Board and Pencil
* No alcohol during rally

OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,
is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar.

Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its
own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to
get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches
to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to
remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,
through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along 
a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change 
surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact 
patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It 
probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, 
but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a 
better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch
forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.
You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
was the rotation that did it.

Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.
Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them
about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.
How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking
for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski
or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged
like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.
I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like
that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.
Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try
one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.
So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,
a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have
countersteering.

Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have
motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what
real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations
of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm 
willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. 

If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's
behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.

Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all
testified that the BATF shot first, they they did not identify themselves
before tossing in concussion grenades (not that anyone inside could have
_heard_ such identification after being near a concussion grenade) and
the announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under
which they were operating - which was a _search_ warrant, by the way,
_not_ an arrest warrant.  In short, perhaps because the BATF is wildly
out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a
compound full of woman and children will not improve their position.
There is a real chance that Koresh will be able to prove self-defense
in court.  That will leave - what? - four officers dead and no one to
blame but the BATF.

Both your reasons are not good ones.  Joe Morgan thinks that Bonds-Clark-
Williams should be the 3-4-5 hitters.  While he believes that Clark-Bonds-
Williams is fine, he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit
ahead of Williams.  I am inclined to agree with him.
Your first reason is not valid because Bonds can hit both lefties and righties
very well.  He hits lefties or righties better than any other Giant
Williams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season.
But, the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive
hitter than Williams, and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving in
the 1, 2 or 3 hitters (who are expected to have high OBPs) than with Williams.
Williams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base open
because of the threat of Bonds stealing.

The Yammie Deltabox and the Hawk frame are conceptually similar
but Yammie has a TM on the name. The Hawk is a purer 'twin spar'

tied together with aluminum extruded beams. The Yammie solution is
a bit more complex.

Well the European Manta and US GT have entirely different bodies. There is
little or no chance that they are the same. The Manta went through several
generations as the coupe version of the Ascona and was OK in its time.

Not true. The Kadett has been in and out of the US market over the years.
The LeMans (old Kadett) is only the latest version.

Sorry, I should have been more specific.  The 750 SS ran the quater in
12.10 @ 108.17.  The last small V-twin Duc we got in the US (and the 400 is
a Pantah based V-twin) was the 500SL Pantah, and it ran a creditable 13.0 @
103.  Modern carbs and what not should put the 400 in the high 12s at 105.

BTW, FZR 400s ran mid 12s, and the latest crop of Japanese 400s will out
run that.  It's hard to remember, but but a new GOOF2 will clobber an old
KZ1000 handily, both in top end and roll-on.  Technology stands still for

Only if you want to stop. Seriously though, every 2 years you should
have this done. Brake fluid absorbs water over time, the water becomes
steam when the fluid gets hot, and steam compresses. You'll also have
better luck with the longevity of master cylinder, calipers and brake
lines.

That's nothing.  When a friend of mine went shopping for a small
sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so
the salespeople wouldn't give her the bimbo treatment.
Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan
Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what we
wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid
kept playing the let me run this price by the sales manager.  After
playing the good salesman, bad salesman game, we finally told him
that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps
we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in
the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick
in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's Don't Get Taken Every Time for a
list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of you'll have to
work with us on this price, also known as each time you come up a
thousand dollars we'll come down ten, the salesmanager gave a signal to
his two sales cronies, stood up, and said well, we can't come down any
more so I guess we can't help you and they trouped out of the room,
leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.
I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they
can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and
I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering
why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the
door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on
the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,
and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few
sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line
(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call
another dealership from his phone!  I said that since he'd announced
that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried
to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our
voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,
anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.
Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he
begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,
we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.

Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out
the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,
customers and all, Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!
So my friend bought a Sentra.

Just so the guilty won't go unpunished, I'll mention that the
sales manager's name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his
refusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the
end, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was
a young novice) that he'd be able to get at least X dollars out of
us, and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks.

Actually I will take your word on it.  I refuse to test it (new 325is) because

	A reasonable umpire would have recognized that Ron Gant was 
disturbed with the call.  A reasonable umpire would have realized that
there was a 1-run game in progress, with two outs in the ninth.  What
Ron Gant did was try to regain his composure.  What a normal baseball
player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument
with the umpire, and since you can't argue balls and strikes, he would
have been ejected from the game.  Ron Gant, by trying to avoid such a
conflict, was penalized for showing some restraint.

	Incidentally, a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been
so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire, as Gant
requested.  If the home plate umpire had appealed to first, the first base
umpire could have wrung up the strike, and Gant would not have been so
upset.  If the call had been a ball, and the catcher had requested the
appeal, it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help.

	Finally, the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so-called
efforts to speed up the game.  The game was played very quickly, it was
just at 2 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth, and the only delays
in the entire game had been *the result* of actions by the umpires (other than
Deion having to clean garbage off the field).

justify all you want.  extended warranties are a ripoff, high profit item for
the dealer.  and you didn't buy 5yr/60k, you get 3yr/36k *free*, so what you
bought is 2yr/24k.  and you still have to pay $50 every time you use this 
great 'warranty'.  better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs
if/when you need it.  considering that your last car was only 1.5 years old,
are you sure you will even keep this new one past it's *free* warranty period?
btw, typical profit on extended warranties is around 80%.  that's right, only
20% of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future
repairs that the group of extended-warranty-people collect.

I'd be willing to make two wagers:
1) Snow doesn't win ROY.
2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.

I'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a
player, and he is on a losing team.

I'm skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this
year, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and
most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.

Could be wrong on either or both, but I think that's the smart way to
bet...

Darryl Strawberry's moon shots were fun!  He can hit those high and far
home runs that if he actually ran them out he'd be rounding second base
by the time they landed.  We used to say that he should have to file a
flight plan at LaGuardia for some of them.  Then _Bull_Durham_ came out
and that was changed.  :-)

On homers he pulled that didn't go high, they were microwave home runs.
Microwave, as in they got outta there in a hurry!  In a game in 1988, he
came off the bench with the flu and on the second pitch send a rocket
down the right field line that didn't even allow Bob Murphy the luxury
of a home run call.  The story went he stayed in the clubhouse, the with
the Mets down by two and two on Davey Johnson sent for him to pinch hit.
He came out of the clubhouse saying one swing and we go home.  He hit
the homer, ran the bases, then went straight for the clubhouse to shower
and go home.

Those were the days....

Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer,
I'll supply one.

Yes, even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering.  Basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left.  It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle
than a bicycle though, because of the extra weight.  (Ok, so my
motorcycle is heavy.  Maybe yous isn't.)

  Well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a Jay fan the thing I feared
worst has happened. The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to start
Williams B in CF.
  I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation, which is
much nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throw
out their to the slaughterhouse because of their experience. Granted, Witt
might be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters
up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has
experience.
  The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the
Jays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their
pitching staff.
  The Orioles should also be there in the end.....

%The grips on my GS are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem

I'd agree with Henry.  The grips are really nice to have in winter,
and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer.  

My only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'.
This has been complained about by every reviewer, official and
unofficial, that's ever talked about these grips.  The 'high' setting
is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things
just get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable
effect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature
about right.  This generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker
winter gloves.  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, I
received a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for
the poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they were
suppose to).

Vibration?  What's that?  I ride a BMW twin.  You can barely tell if
the engine is fired up or not most of the time, smoother than silk

   Yes. Nobody is watching them.  If they get caught, there is no punishment
 at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping
 with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand
 what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen
 any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching
 him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would
 inevitably wind up dead early anyway.

   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,
 he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-
 gradually heat it, the frog will cook.  This is what the entertainment
 industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our
 modern North American society have done to us over the years.  Now that
 we are about to be 'cooked', we may have woken up too late.

  And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren't doing much 
 about it, either.  With both parents working in this society, where is
 the stabilizing influence at home?   Latchkey children are everywhere!
 And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to

 one is home to stop it.

  This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn
 than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is
 shorter school hours and more leisure time!  I say keep the kids in
 school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when
 they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There
 is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will
 bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.  This is
 just shifting the parents' own responsibilities off on someone else to
 whom it's not a life-long committment, but rather just a job.

Only if you persist in believing that Peter Gammons is more knowledgable about
baseball than the average mailbox.  Okay, I'm overstating.  Still, the man 
actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this
year did not pitch in the majors last year.

Huh?

IMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the 
other expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues.
In Gammons' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some
increase will be seen.  He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump
in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season.  He's still
full of it...

Yeah, but what's your point?  You still need the offense to score more runs

The Braves do have a fine pitching staff.  But that's still only half the

Actually, that'd be 155 mph and 60 mph (the legal speed limit for trucks) 
in *two* lanes, each direction. It's a hell of a rush when those trucks fly

Damn straight! As far as I've heard, unless the owner is _very_
hard up, the GT-40s are not for sale at any price that mere
mortals could afford.

>will be forever King of the Road, the GT-40 isn't road legal.

I think the GT-40 actually _is_ street legal, although that particular
question is moot (see the price figures below).

>This car was right hand drive (weren't they all like that?). How much does
>a GT-40 go for? How many were made?

I wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40
registry (as of '88 or so). There were precious few of them made 
(fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough
to qualify for the Manufacturer's Cup, or whichever series it
was that Shelby broke Ferarri's 13-year winning streak in in '65),
and they are all accounted for. The last price I saw estimated on a
GT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that's right, ONE MILLION
US DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari
that it would blow the doors off of ;-).

I don't recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although
I'm certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify
for racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think, 
and/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They
also used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the
original trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was
rear-engine, rear-drive, with the bundle of snakes exhaust
headers...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I
can't remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby
Cobra Daytona Coupe...I'll try and find that reference.

	The Olds Supreme Convertible got high marks in C/D's recent test, if
you can get by the stupid body moldings and stuff.  The Saab 900 ragtop may
be out of your range, but its a good choice.  Is there a new F-car convertible?

	Ok, so in my ongoing search for a sport utility, here's the latest;


Toyota 4runner:

	 Small. Small Small Small. The interior of this vehical is impossible
	for a large person. Too bad; it would have been the winner otherwise.

Nissan Pathfinder:
	
	Very low ceiling. My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also has
	a cheap-looking interior.

Isuzu Trooper:

	Class act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable,
	handled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE. But it's huge,
	and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk; also the manual shift is 
	weird and kind of awkward. I'd buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10
	shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to 
	park in in San Francisco. No Thanks.


Chevy Blazer:

	Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still 
	too small.

Ford Explorer:

	This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader.
	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the
	trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would
	be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and
	shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like,
	but it's acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to get
	into, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10 shorter
	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual 
	shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying. 


	So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it?
	Anyone had any major problems? Heard any horror stories? 

	Also, any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo, both being essentially
	the same vehical?

I can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictory
advice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybody's got an
opinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is
extremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't
know.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code
only tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a
wide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any
advice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.

If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,
study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really
happens.  Read Fight Your Ticket too, but don't miss the little
section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're
basically screwed.

As you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here in
California.  I've carefully prepared for court, bringing witnesses and
revealing serious holes in the officer's story, only to be slapped with
the maximum allowable fine (plus assessments of over 100%) - the
message clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public trying
his own cases.

So here's my advice when you find yourself with a ticket:  Take traffic
school if you can.  If it's a serious matter get a lawyer.  A lawyer
can present the exact same case as you, the difference is the
sentence.

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means slow down.

Seriously, concentrate on being very smooth, and you will make her
experience much more enjoyable.  Even a normal upshift causes your
passenger to bob, so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the
clutch to eliminate this.  It's more work, but your passenger will
appreciate it!  Also, I've found that using more rear brake than normal
helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops, which
makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on.  If you're going
sport riding, have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves
against the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your
arms.  (Again your bike will dive less too)

This does sound good, but I heard it tends to leave more grit, etc in the 
oil pan.  Also, I've been told to change the old when it's hot before the
grit has much time to settle.

Any opinions?

I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car.  Before
I delve into its innards, I thought I'd check net.wisdom on the
subject. :)

It's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know)
2.0l EFI 4-banger
auto
35k miles

When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at
highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of
getting stuck in 3rd gear.  As a result, when you stop for
a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting
for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission
to reset and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when
put in drive.  

My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting
stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up
converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least
likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum
hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of
vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).

My background is that my father owns a service station and
I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Please
feel free to be as technical as you want. :)

I'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free
beer. <grin>

The only problem with hi5ing a cyclist is their always in the right hand lane.
I hafta roll down the other window and hi5 them on the back.  Oh well, I 
think they appreciate the thought. 

Regards, Ted.

I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the
Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East.  It was also his career high
48th. 

Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the
1986 ALCS.  The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox *1* strike away from
the pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run.
That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen in
baseball.  The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the same
thing done to them in the WS against the Mets.  Speaking of the METS,
isn't it strange how the NLCS that year with the Astros ALMOST
mirrored the 1980 NLCS with the Phillies??  The Astros have been
painfully close twice I must admit.

So, hey, like, does this work the other way? If I was to like, you
know, strap a generator to my FZJRR11000KRX and route its output to
the chain, could I increase the horsepower? 32 meters a sec is
pretty nice and all, but, I'd still like to be able to blow away 
a Goldwing without going to nitro...

Hey, man, you brought it up.  I agree completely, driving drunk is really
stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But
DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as 
motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the
insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly.

In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue,
but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto,
admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.

Minor point:  Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but
not with the Jets in mind as the tennant.  The New York Football Giants
had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was
having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee
Stadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea.
When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the
new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using
the new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the
Cosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into
the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to
promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing
with the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.

I'm under the impression that when Murph says it, he means it!  As a
regular goer to Shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and
renovated the place.  Remember, this is its 30th Year!

Step 1) Join the AMA (American Motorcycling Association).  Call 1-800-AMA-JOIN.

Step 2) After you become a member, they will ship your bike, UNCRATED to 
just about anywhere across the fruited plain for a few hundred bucks.

I have used this service and have been continually pleased.  They usually
only take a few days for the whole thing, and you do not have to prepare
the bike in any way (other than draining the gas).  Not to mention that
it is about 25% of the normal shipping costs (by the time you crate a bike
and ship it with another company, you can pay around $1000)

The major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age.  Even if
Morris were performing as well as Clemens right now, and were likely to
this season, nobody would trade Clemens for Morris straight up because
Clemens has more of his career left.

A question for any high-mileage Audi owners out there: I am
interested in buying a 1989 Audi 5000S for $5500 Cdn.  The
reason the car is selling for so little is that is has
155000 km on it (just under 100000 mi.).  The car's owner
claims the car is in good condition.  My question is: how
reliable are Audi 5000s with mileage that high?  Would it
be worthwhile for me to buy the car?  Any problem areas that
I should look out for?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Post responses and/or
e-mail me.

Thanks

Oh, lord.  This is where I came in.

Obcountersteer:  For some reason, I've discovered that pulling on the
wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong
side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  For
example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn 
right (Hi, Lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned
over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.  Maybe
I need psychological help.

Obcountersteer v2.0:Anyone else find it ironic that in the weekend-and-a-
night MSF class, they don't mention countersteering until after the
first day of riding?

 I am a little confused on all of the models of the 88-89 bonnevilles.
I have heard of the LE SE LSE SSE SSEI. Could someone tell me the
differences are far as features or performance. I am also curious to
know what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. And how much
less than book value can you usually get them for. In other words how
much are they in demand this time of year. I have heard that the mid-spring
early summer is the best time to buy.

ATTN: Those who live inthe Philadelphia Metro area...

Back in September I was listening to WIP, and I remember the morning
guys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell.  The topic of conversation
was a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new park
was suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor was
optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Has
there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream?
I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the
new convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would be
nice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leave
the VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case,
the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's another
story).  I want to see that day!

foot in mouth again, drew.  the first generation mr 2's were 1.6's which

wrong and wrong.  mitsubishi owns the patent, which has since expired
which is why everybody with a shred of integrity is putting balance
shafts into their big 4's.. the notable exception is nissan.. and only
for the us market suckers.  i guess we need to write to C&D and start
telling them to publish graphs for engine vibration over rpm.  then
you'll see usenet discussions of the form: engine A has peak
vibrations 3 dB less than engine B, therefore engine A is better than
engine B.

Be fair.  He did walk 6 batters in 6.1 IP.  He also allowed only three

There is no such thing as a must win game this early in the season.

james, i really hate to do this, but try reading the damn posts!
never was a t'bird mentioned.  The discussion was about SHO's and
'stangs not being up to spec.  I do not know about t'birds.  I
only know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded
a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff.  This does not
in any way  disencourage* me from wishing to own one, nor does it make it
a bad car.  It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra
bit of safety  and tossed in larger brakes, as the wheels are plenty large
enough for them to fit (if memory serves right, which it may very well not)
and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it.

    We here are *VERY* interested in info on R12 substitutes (in fact I
 think we really need all the info on this we can get).

    I would really appreciate technical, supply, and hardware-upgrade
 details.  

   Also, R12 is a useful solvent/reagent in the extraction/production of
 certain pharmaceuticals.  Any info on the substitutes' corresponding
 usefullness?

    I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure
 we are compliant with the regulations.  The trouble with regulations is
 that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what
 you should do instead.

     I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol
 which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of
 the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the
 Ozone Depletion Problem.)

     Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast
 to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other
 greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by
 infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem
 (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same
 thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's
 (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which
 are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.
 Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help
 the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.

	Don't just nab it, POUNCE on it.  These are fairly rare bikes, and
they are MORE than adequate for putting a big brown stripe in your shorts.
Does a 50mph power wheelie appeal to you?  I thought it would...

No, the Grand canyon is not too far away.  Short side trips to Kolob
(between Cedar City and Hurricane) and Pipe Springs (on the way from
Hurricane to the Grand Canyon) may be interesting--they are right
off the highway.  Pipe Springs (a small fort) gives you real insight
into just how the pioneers lived.  You have missed one major must
see attraction--Cedar Breaks in the mountains above cedar city.
Take lots of film--they have a reason for calling this kodachrome
country.  Natural Bridges in the four corners area is also very
scenic, but may be too far off your route.  Monument valley is
spectacular, but again may be too far away.

I am looking at buying a Dual Sport type motorcycle. This is my first

the following motorcycles, good or bad.

	Honda XR250L
	Suzuki DR350S
	Suzuki DR250ES
	Yamaha XT350

Most XXX vs. YYY articles I have seen in magazines pit the Honda XR650L 
against another cycle, and the 650 always comes out shining. Is it safe
to assume that the 250 would be of equal quality ?

You raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff -- how much money
do you want to spend for that kind of protection?  You could buy a
Volvo, Saab, or 'Benz and get really good crash protection (and other
luxuries) but you'll pay significantly more for it.  In my case it's
out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget.

Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can
have is a good old 3-point seatbelt.  Nowadays, at least in the US,
you get an airbag if you get a 3-point belt so (presumably) you get an
added safety benefit there as well.  That's something I certainly look
for and which can be had in inexpensive cars.

My $.02, of course.

    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment
of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to
both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike
Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the 
big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance
He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he 
had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  
  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:
Morning show:
  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, 
and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti
had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries
to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of
sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he
interjects humor and politics into his show.
10 AM to 12 Noon:
  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their
abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the
advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller
who is asking about who the local team is going to draft
in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get
better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that
they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless
it was a major story.
  I would consider this even because they are two different
styles of host.

12 Noon to 2 PM:
  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to 
Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been
on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability
to transcend the homer mentality of the Philadelphia fan
base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia 
spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.
Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0
score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')
I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight
and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating
hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on 
either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and
you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.

2PM to 4PM:
  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and 
Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided
in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,
but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10
to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do
get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so
it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the
appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which
are often hilarious.  

4 PM to 7 PM:
  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like
Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  
I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he
was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly
homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there
is a game on that night, but you will see later for the 
reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.

7 PM to Midnight:
  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes
Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on
charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my
nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go
nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)
On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets
Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the
west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course
I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but
WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.
(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the
IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))
During the summer, it
is all talk on WIP.


Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with
the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and
12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

We cannot isolate completely, Roger, but we can make a pretty good
estimate. I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can really
measure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; the
difference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens and
Morris? The differences are too great there.

In your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won it
all ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly best,
how can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace where
they beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a player
a little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions,
the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team
win. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the
team, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.)

Baseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It is
absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success
or failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most
cases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe
Carter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al.
Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as
Herm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon. To define the quality
of the team as a sum of its components (as I do, albeit imperfectly)
is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the
mean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you
do)

I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where I purchased
the car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  The second time,
after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing
list (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and
made it *much* better.  However it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough
roads, and *still* squeals when I open/close the window in wet weather (anyone
elses's do this?)

>>Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!

I got two keys with my car, but only ONE remote-entry push-button thingie!
But then, I bought my 93 with 2500 miles, and  I think it may have been a
repossession ... so I'm not surprised something was missing :-(

>>horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)

I am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where
it describes the procedure to follow if you discover something on your Ford
that could ... cause ... serious injury ... threaten lives ... etc).  Something
about notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford.  Those little
you've-got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep buttons are
TERRIBLE.

Well, I guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad.  When someone
hears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big American car.  They may
not associate the sound with a small jap car style car (like the Probe is).

>>Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 
>Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.

The mudflaps help a lot.

>>transmission (the 5 speed is a must)

I have always been a 5-speed guy.  Almost every car I've ever owned has been
a 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I
(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty
high-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with
torque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the
highway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I 
probably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been
around 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the
control of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out
to be very convenient.  It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and
drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in 
we-like-to-control-your-life Massachusetts :-)


>>No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)

Shakes and rattles has been my main gripe.  I've gotten them to fix the
worst of them, but I fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will
be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older.

>>Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

On my 89 Probe GL, I got about 40K out of the original Goodyears,
and had driven the replacement tires (Bridgestone) 50K miles when
I tradeed the car.  The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe
look like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow
tread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.  But the car handles
very very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough
surface.

>interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically

Definitely.  Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  The
car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it.

Having driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension interesting.
The car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm
ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet
the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and
feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.

>>If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find

Well I wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the
person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As
mentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, consider the back seat
as a parcel shelf.  No biggie to me though (if it had been, I'd not
have bought the car!  (but it's definitely not a family car)).

>>Also, there's a lot of glass

A/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93.  The 93 in particular sends out
a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX.  That lots of glass you
mentioned is what gives the car the very good visibility reports you
see in all the write-ups.  Most sports/sporty cars don't have that
good visibility.

>>I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.

The complaints I've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on 
the GT.  Of course being a different engine, that is a differeent 
exhaust system.

I was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement.
Since I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice, 
I was/am due a refund from Ford.  I applied in February and am Still
waiting.   :-(

>gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my

>that I was expecting the worst from them!

Yes.  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touch-up
adjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy
for them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  They 
did make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(

I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm.  But I seriously
feel the car design is sound, and expect it to do very well.

Not clear to me at all.  I'd certainly rather have a team who was winning
4-1 games than 2-1 games.  In the 2-1 game, luck is going to play a much
bigger role than in the 4-1 game.

Hi, maybe someone can help me here...
I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now.
The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it.
A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi).
The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification
he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced
to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before
selling the car to me.)

Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know
what this could mean...
Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items?
Or is this an indication that the car was abused?
Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?
The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but,
I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away
in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.

Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and
well kept, it's currently out of warranty
(a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km
worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for
any repair bills...
But, I also need a car for 5 people...  

When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?

I would very much appreciate your input in this.
Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup.
Thanks!

Ryan

I saw the replay several times too.  No question about it.  Daryl missed
the ball, *then* the fan caught it.  Daryl is so tall that he had the
first shot at the ball.  Daryl's just whining again.  I think it shows a
lack of class when Tommy, Daryl and the Dodgers blame a single fan for
losing the game.  What about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball?
What about the pitchers that gave up 6 runs up to that point?  Sorry, Tommy.
If it were a 2-1 game and Daryl was 5 feet 2 inches tall, then maybe -
just maybe - you'd have an argument.

The FT-500 is a good beginner's bike with:
  *  a reasonable seating position
  *  enough power to get you up and around, but
       not so much it'll scare the bejeebers out of you
  *  tips over well, and easy to pick up
       (don't ask)
  *  simple maintenance

I've had mine for four or so years, and haven't had any
serious problems with it.  I bought it used for $750 with
about 8000 miles on it.

Just last week, someone in the neighborhood stopped by to
ask me about it; whether I thought it was a good beginner's
bike, is it comfortable and powerful enough, blah blah blah...
Seems he found one used for < $500 with about 3600 miles on it.

The reall trick mod I've heard was to take the front end from
a 600 hurricane and slide it in.  This was from a guy who
campaigns two Ascots in SOS racing.  He says they do pretty
well too, once you strip off the starter, lights and other
assorted street paraphernalia, its a pretty fast and light bike.

i'm sorry, as i have never heard of any of this.  Guess they don't think
it's important enough for a classroom, and i was going on what i've seen
in pics.(some movies--real nice scource there, huh?)  I just always 
recall thinking that GOOD roads of asphalt didn't come around til the
Interstate Hiway Act, or whatever they called it(60's?), and that wood and
cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression, except in
overpopulated places like England and US cities.  Obviously netwisdom

Hey folks,

Saw the Giants play ball at the 'Stick Saturday, April 17.  It was the game
where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,
two-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn't the game where the fans
threw the give-away fotoballs onto the field in response to the homer --
too bad, huh?)

Well, the 'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it
was cold then.  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick.  The
wind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.

At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on
the field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed
mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run
out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths
the infield) and grab the trash.

It might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given
anything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins here!

Whaddaya think?

I had a '82 Saab 900 Turbo, and now have a '87 BMW 325is

There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of
engineering. The BMW wins hands down. After 5 years I was sick and tired
of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB. The 6-year
old BMW is still as sweet as it was new.

But I see you are posting from western MA. BMW's **SUCK** in the snow.
I have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and I
still try to avoid driving in the snow. I happily took the SAAB through
blizzard conditions without a worry. I would say this is the single design
flaw in the BMW.

  To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner.  He has
brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that
were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don't
think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.
McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point
that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the
bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid
outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The
pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young
Houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat is
the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.

	I'll second that.  In addition, I find my hazards to be more
often used than my horn.  At speeds below 40mph on the interstates,
quite common in mountains with trucks, some states require flashers.
In rural areas, flashers let the guy behind you know there is a tractor
with a rather large implement behind it in the way.  Use them whenever 
you need to communicate that things will deviate from the norm.

Stankiewicz?  I doubt it.

Koufax was one of two Jewish HOFs: the other is Hank Greenberg.

Other good players: Buddy Myer, Johnny Kling, Norm and Larry Sherry,
Ken Holtzman, Saul Rogovin, Ed Reulbach.  

There have been over 150 Jewish major leaguers.  A few years ago there
was an article about someone who keeps track of this in Spy magazine;
the article was entitled Jews on First, of course.

There have also been at least two books on the subject.

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling
or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.
However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the
people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I
feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to
go but that they would deserve it more. 

IMHO 
Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he
could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not
think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the
game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I
still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.

Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several
season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are
(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a
bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other
people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial
contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are
some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he
was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to
and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I
think it deserves some consideration.

Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would
deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.

Darrell Evans - No.

Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although
a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not
sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both
the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just
think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.

Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the
top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.

Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I
talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been
instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very
good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers
offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for
every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have
shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved
games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a
game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more
than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).
Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does
George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.

Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone
making a case for him. 

Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might
bring up his name.

Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still
has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my
probably will turn into a definately.

Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him
having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not
hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the
contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would
not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even
top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame
because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -
even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL
the possible votes.

So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do
but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least
not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.

Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan
Maybe - Murray and L. Smith
No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman

As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this
up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.

Yes, however, with the top off and the rear window down this car is more 
like a convertible than a coupe.  Think of it as a convertible with an

I have tested both vehicles (identically
equipped), both for week-long periods.
Curiously (and consider these are test
vehicles), I found the Mercury higher
in build quality than the Nissan.

Either choice is good, but beware that
I did not experience reasonable mileage
with the V6.  Average city driving was
<15mpg, with about 21 avg. on the highway.

Both were optioned to the hilt (the Nissan
had leather!).  The Villager was in the
$24K range and the Nissan was over $26K.

Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.  What competition did 
Alomar have?  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken, and the same year as Boggs,
Gwynn, and the other magicians.  So less attention was given to Sandberg. 
Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre.  Besides the 
numbers don't count.  National league pitchers are much better pitchers.

I hear ya!  Then again, we must remember that we are indeed Cub fans, and
that the Cubs will eventually blow it.  After all, the Cubs are the easiest
team in the National League to root for.  No Pressure.  You know they will
lose eventually.  Oh well, I suppose we must have faith.  After all, they
do look pretty good, and they don't even have Sandberg back yet.

Funny, I thought the numbering scheme for both Lexus and Infiniti was
related to sticker price more than anything else, i.e. Infiniti G20 (around
20K), Q45 (around 45K), Lexus ES250 (RIP) (around 25K), Lexus ES300 (around
30K), etc.

Is there a conspiracy theory there?

It's exactly as dangerous as it looks. You're hard to see and have little
protection. Keeping out of trouble means knowing your limits, keeping your
machine in good shape and being able to predict and make up for every stupid
move that drivers make out there. We deal with it because it's fun, but
staying alive takes a conscious effort.

What I was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very HIGH speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you, you are stupid (of course, it depends on the circumstances).  I have had some VERY scary instances when I assumed this and I dont think all of the fault was the other guy (now if he was going 25 in a 55 thats a whole different story)

ok.  I can agree to this, because, as we have both proved, what is ideally

When your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object, there are only four things
to dissipate the energy: the immoveable object, the helmet shell, the helmet
liner, the rider's head, the rider's ego (ok, five). Assuming that the helmet/
head assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in
the other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's the
the liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were
cracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area. If it's the head
that's getting jiggled, maybe the new gear isn't of as high quality after all?

Uh, he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car, and smashing it
into a tree, as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car. And the 
speeding reported was over 100 mph; reckless driving.

I don't know what you were reading or watching, but I sure saw a LOT about 
that, and about Dykstra's poker games. Most of the writing was along the lines
of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was, and how he'd hurt the team by
wracking himself and the catcher up, etc. ESPN raised questions about his
judgement, etc. The print media here in the SF area questioned why disciplinary
action wouldn't be taken against Dykstra, and one article pointed out that if
Lenny wanted to kill himself, there were ways that wouldn't endanger other
people's lives. Then there was Dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it
was, etc.

 Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they
would be safe at 55-65. Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter,
wider and slightly banked. 

Example: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)
and I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south
east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the
left strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled
into the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't 
a car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane.
Now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and 
over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then
that I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he 
had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and 
changed lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so.
I was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out 
of his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to 
think of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not 
left the time he needed to dodge me.

Rule: Just because your car can do 100+, and  your way is clear,
don't assume it will stay that way.

KC(?) news was doing a report on that.  They said that McRae is
really a batting coach and not a manager.  But for some reason
he took the job.  Whatever the reason, the Royals need a new
manager now...while it is too late.

He evidentally got hit in the elbow by a Fernando pitch.  His arm swelled
from the elbow to the wrist (or something like that).  They took X-rays
of the arm and there is nothing damaged.  He missed the last game with the
Orioles, but he is suppose to be ready for the next game.

They don't.  It's a closed access road, you pay to get in (if you don't
have a resident sticker), and they simply don't open the gates if

We have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration. Let me ask 
a similar question from the aviation field. You must have seen images of prop 
planes with all cylinders exposed. I have seen up to 8 cylinders positioned 
radially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle. 
This arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma. How can one crankshaft 
throw accomodate 8 rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the 
outside.

You're supposed to spray it in your ears so you won't be

NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy (name possibly
garbled by me), an official historian for the CIA.  She has won an Emmy
for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothing
but which sounds good).  She said that among other things, Berg was the 
principal spy for the OSS (CIA's WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomic
programs, because of his physics background and language skills.  She said
that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had 
instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb
research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him).
(I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb
program, but I don't know how reliable this is.)  Unfortunately, NPR didn't
mention any kind of a book she's writing -- I'd certainly buy it.

(In case you're wondering about baseball relevance, Berg was a longtime
MLB backup catcher.  He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that toured
Japan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because
he was one of the few Americans, much less MLB players, who spoke Japanese.
Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids,
according to McCarthy.)

Responsible and in love?  I believe that's a contradiction
in terms.

Unless you're really brave (read: reckless) a 500cc sport
bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first
year of riding.  Getting more than that really is overkill,
as you'll never even want to use it.  The following bikes
can be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a novice
to manage, and are plenty high performance:
    Kawasaki EX-500
    Honda VF-500 Interceptor
    Suzuki GS-550E

The 0-100mph time of the EX-500 at full throttle is way
sooner than you're ready for it.  :-)  With something
as small as a 250, you'd probably be wishing for more
power pretty quickly (unless it's a TZR or RGV :).

Now, I'm not saying that you're 100% certain to kill
yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR-750.  Plenty
of people have started riding on those bikes and done
just fine.  What I am saying is that it's a waste of
money, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you
drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping.
You'll never get the throttle more than half open
anyway, so why spend the extra 2000 bucks?

 Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!

 BACKGROUND
 ----------

 The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions 
 devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad 
 interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, 
 roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,
 motosports enthusiasts.

 The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little
 over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from
 New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada
 Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.

 The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need 
 to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of 
 performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise 
 ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.

 Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to 
 issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be flame-free.  

 HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION
 ---------------------------------

 You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:


        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM


 Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day
 (depending on the topic). 

   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the
       list directly.
 
 After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive
 an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner
 so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in
 order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.
 
 Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily
 or digest distribution (as per your initial request).

 HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION
 ----------------------------------

 It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a
 single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out 
 whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the
 frequency of postings this appears to be about every other
 day.

 Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every 
 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:


        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM


 HOW TO POST TO THE LIST
 -----------------------

 This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:


        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM


 Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may
 not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it
 (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)
 you can include a metoo line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX
 based mail systems). 

 BOUNCES
 -------

 Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace
 the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with
 bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,
 sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of
 employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive
 bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and
 if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I
 administer this list) contact me through my administration
 hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce.

The tribe will be in town from April 16 to the 19th.
There are ALWAYS tickets available! (Though they are playing Toronto,
and many Toronto fans make the trip to Cleveland as it is easier to
get tickets in Cleveland than in Toronto.  Either way, I seriously
doubt they will sell out until the end of the season.)

RADAR (Radio Association Defending Airwave Rights) says that Geico
insurance not only buy's Radar for police but also actively lobbies
states to promote making Radar Detectors illegal.   I think the
buying part is a misuse of money but the Radar Detector part shows
how little they know about the issue.  No study I am aware of has ever
concluded that detectors have a negative impact on safety or that
users have a higher average speed.  Incompetence by Geico?  I think
so.

Summary: 1992 EWB II Stats wanted

	Hello, my friends and I are running the Homewood Fantasy Baseball
League (pure fantasy baseball teams). Unfortunely, we are running the league
using Earl Weaver Baseball II with the Comm. Disk II and we need the stats
for the 1992 season. (Preferably the 1992 Major League Stat Disk) We have
the '92 total stats but EWB2 needs the split stats otherwise we have 200
inning games because the Comm. Disk turns total stats into vs. L's stats
unless you know both right and left -handed stats.

	So, if anyone has the EWB2 '92 Stat Disk please e-mail me!

Definitely!

Safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car. I won't buy a 
small car like a Civic or whatever.

Great = Safety + Handling + Speed  -  for me

Seems to me that you would be more dead in a small car than a large car 
after an accident.

The whire wheels aren't chromed, they were to be painted silver/grey.

The accelerating from a stop shouldn't be doggy because of the light
weight of the car.

Don't pull the topto make it reach the snaps, I pulled a couple out of
the top doing that.  Replacing the spanps usually doesn't work.  Let it
sit in th e sun, open on the car for a couple hours, the try,  GENTLY!!!!

I continually blew up the #4 connecting rod bearing, be sure your not
buring too much oil.

Don't expect too much of a smooth ride.  The lever arm shocks hold the
road, and your bladder.  The are ultra-expensive.  Supposedly the can be
rebuilt.  J. C. Whitney sell a shock replacement kit the uses standard
shocks.

I had to rebuid boththe brake and clutch master cylinder, in addition to
the clutch slave.  This work made a world of changes.

Be sure the carb is the original type replacement.  My 1970 had dual
Stomberg oil dampenned side draft carbs.

Ask if the clutch has ever been replaced.  To replace the engine and
tranny have to be pulled as a unit.

If you need more, I had mine all through hiogh school.  Lots of
maintenance to use every day.

Hi,

My friend's 1983 Toyota Tercel accelerates by itself without using
the gas peddel. The repairman said it has a internal leak of air in
the carburetor and needs a new carburetor (costs $650). She likes
to know if it is possible to fix the problem without replacing
the whole carburetor.

Thank you.

Realizing the taterific importance of this work, John Palmer and I
concluded that we might be able to pool some resources. I have not yet
gone through the archives that Jonathan sent to me; when I do, I will
send out an official introduction to the Deep Drive Derby.

However, I wonder if we need to rename the project, now that the
principal investigator and research archive have changed. Send your
suggestions for a rename of the study to me, at the address given
above.

And, just think:  it's opening day.  Soon, the balls will be flying
out (no, get your minds out of the gutter) of the ball parks, and
helpless bystanders will be injured by balls reentering the
atmosphere. (and you thought that meteorite showers were made of
rocks!)

Who will be the stars this year? Can anyone hope to combat Brad
Arnsberg's record start to last year?

The season is young, the balls newly rubbed in mud, the hot dogs
starting to boil for the rest of the year. Play ball (and take cover).

And may all your sliders hang.

Vince.

born with, or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few
times? (how many times?)
 
   I would think you'd have to have a certain amount of feel

	You are absolutely correct.  Braves fans are nothing but a bunch of
bandwagoners.  Correct me if I am wrong, but 4 or 5 years ago you couldnt give
away a ticket to see the Braves play.I  would bet my next paycheck that 80% of
the so-called Braves fans living outside of Georgia at the present time can not
name more than 3 players from their 1988 season. On the other hand, ask any
Cubs fan living anywhere in the United States to name 3 players from any given
year and 80% of them probably could.
	Granted, the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park, but
that does not mean they diserve the title America's Team
	The only reason they are considered America's team is because of Ted
Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation.
	I'll consider Toronto AMerica's team before the Braves


	GO REDS!

As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the 
pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it 
comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox
fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you
with short memories. short lives, or both.  

To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism
from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based
on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a 
team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean
years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  

Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if
Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The
fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans
supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of 
detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what 
happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly 
not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,
remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that
far, let alone beat Baltimore.

Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football
and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what
the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.

I have a 86 chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. It's odometer turned 90k
and the sensor light started blinking. I went to the dealer and he said
it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor. He
said, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when it
had 77k, I don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k.  He
quoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. The part cost $30
outside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor
is placed too deep in the engine parts. He suggested I wait till it
malfunctions before I do anything.  If anyone out there owns a chevy
sprint, I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed. Also,
did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help. Also,
what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction. 
  Any help would be greatly apprecisted

         Call around to some wrecking yards in your area and,if they have
    any, look at Fiero seats. They are right down on the floor like a vette
    and not too wide.If you can't find any let me know and i'll call around
    here for you. I'm sure these yards ship stuff all the time.

I'm surprised. I know of a local case where a guy took his Saturn back five
times to complain they hadn't properly eliminated a rattling noise...so Saturn
gave him a new car.

You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
doesn't see it right away...Valentine is the best detector by far (as stated
by Car and Driver) and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from.
 It also gives the amount of threats it is picking up, so if you go through
 the same place everyday, and it always goes off there, you can glance at the
 number of threats the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop.
  It's about $300 and you can only get it factory direct..one problem.

Hi all you Ryno fans (and those interested...)
Todays Chicago Tribune had this written in it today in regards to
Ryne Sandberg...

Ryne Sandberg is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a broken
left hand and could be back in the lineup by May 1, manager Jim
Lefebvre said Friday.
Doctors cleared Sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball in his 
gloved hand.
'' I'm not surprised his rehabilitation has been moved up,'' said
Lefebvre.  '' He's a fast healer, and he doesn't like being on the 
disabled list.  He's been running since he was hurt [March 5] and
is in the best shape of his life.  May 1 is his target date for
getting back in the lineup.

Hold on to your hats Cub fans...more later as information
presents itself.

Jeffery

   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.
   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, 
   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler
back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled
Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you 
can't really communicate.

Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how
they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately
and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning
thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a
pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay
perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn
and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always
screws up the line I've picked out.

Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:
	- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.
	- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not
	  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount
	  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)
	- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)
	- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many
	  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)
	- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and
	  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're
	  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel
	  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  
	- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be 
	  gradual, so I can compensate.
	- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.
	- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right 
	  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how
	  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to
	  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to 
	  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, 
	  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED 
	  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with 
	  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.
	  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the
	  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her
	  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to 
	  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)

Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, 
tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.
Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.

Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little
mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will
be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.
It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the 
first trip!

Good luck -- have fun!

>bob vesterman.

Some thoughts and facts,

1.)  Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.  However he has almost
nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he
does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name.
(The handbook, but not the scoreboard).  To the best of my knowledge, the
only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section
of the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.

2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James' early stuff was hampered
by the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price.
Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  You
can call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their
database, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you could
just log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Having
attempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they
just don't do that.  In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making the
information available at all.

3.)  That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too.
I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers 
desire to have the book come out sooner than April.

Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer.

(Bias alert.  I am a former part-time employee of STATS.)

The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their
quest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers.
Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he
has also led the team in past years for hitting into double
plays, or at least been among the leaders.
 
Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play
every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just
one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.
 
Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.
The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an
effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez
were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.
Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might
have seen him lifted in the third in past years.
 
Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.
The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls
in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great
on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to
steal and has at least one pick off at first.
 
Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on
defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers
some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.
I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw
seem to have come out of theirs.

QUESTION: what's your experience with car wash wax?

This is the liquid type of wax in bottles that you pour it in
water, sponge it on you car, hose it off, and dry it with cloth.
Many people have used it. It is very easy to work with and gives
seeminly the same visual results as that of paste type of wax.

But, does it last long? Does it have any negative effects to car
paint?

Can you forward your reply directly to my email id? Thanks.

James

Drivel.  I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I 
ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, 
which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 
miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put 
together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 
cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but 
considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the 
new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a 
shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next 
year (according to a WSJ article).
 
Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in 
Popular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 
1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.  Although they described 
it as a seriously handsome car with broad shoulders, I thought 
it looked pretty boring in that view.  Roofline reminded me of a 
Toyota Celica (yuch!).  Description of mechanicals same as has 
been reported from the PM article.

In defense of the drivers, who are in the right lane.  Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.  

Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake
cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  

BTW, If no one else is around, then GO FOR IT!.

Don't worry about this -- they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do
  make a claim. They'll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end
  when they leave you in the lurch.

>>>I've read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
>>>guns by police depts (I'm not sure where).
More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals 
  showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I
  know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a
  and some local governments.
The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can
  tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make
  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most
  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but 
  this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called
  extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost
  universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an
  increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you
  a riskier driver to insure.
Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!

Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go
with one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customer
discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as
commission. That's another story for another day.

I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every
30K to let you know it's time for a check up.  When that light goes on, I just
take it to the delaer tell them It's that time and they work on it for 4 hou
and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)
I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for
service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the
Oxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have
never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.
Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have
something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only
MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced
if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and
Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  

What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need
to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for
another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light
bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against
the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light
will go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't
find it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little
and good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?

I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.

It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.

No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing
so loudly, that it's quite remarkable that I was able to come
to a stop with the rubber side up.

The duck, BTW, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both
sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.

The bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to
my belly button.

What a great day! Got back home last night from some fantastic skiing
in Colorado, and put the battery back in the FXSTC. Cleaned the plugs,
opened up the petcock, waited a minute, hit the starter, and bingo it
started up like a charm! Spent a restless night anticipating the first
ride du saison, and off I went this morning to get my state inspection
done. Now my bike is stock (so far) except for HD slash-cut pipes, and
all went well with my New Hampshire State Inspection (meaning all my
lights worked OK) until the dude produces a decibel meter and tells me
about the new NH law about MC noise.....huh?  sez I....and he has me
start her up and rev to about 3000 rpm....I FAIL cuz I register 120 DB,
and the max allowed is 110! If I fail with these pipes, there are gonna
be a whole lotta seriously pissed off bikers round here when they go
for inspection.

But hey, its a new experience! I have never really felt like a menace

with a slight swagger to my step, and a narrow lidded look... I sensed
my faculty colleagues unease with my new intimidating status...and
women's glances seemed to linger just a little longer....or perhaps
that was my imagination.......*sigh*

Now I need to install my new BUB pipes and single fire ignition....I
wonder how I will do after that!?

	I agree that Hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do
and also that Gant should have listened to him.  However, what is with this
policy of trying to speed up the games.  You are the first person 
( non-mediot ) I have seen endorse this policy.  I have no problem with the
length of games at all and am tired of the ESPN crowd ( and other announcers )
bitching about it.  I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking
at their watches and shouting Hurry up!  If I cough up big bucks for a 
ticket, I don't mind a game that last more than 2:10.  I really don't
understand it.  

	Games are longer now for several reasons:  more pitching changes,
more basestealing ( and throws to first ), etc...I think a very small factor
is the increased time it takes Jose Canseco/ Deion Sanders/ [insert fancy
showboat ballplayer here] to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the
batter's box.  My impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this
an issue because they like shorter games - they get to head back to hotel
bar, eat steaks, get drunk, tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase
stewardesses around the bar.  Sure they want the game over with.  Print 
journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games:
they have deadlines.  The ESPN guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy - they
constantly harp on this - primarily because they often have to work late 
when the game goes longer than 2:30.

	Maybe I am just a ne'er-do-well with nothing better to do, but I 
would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you.

	As a parenthetical note, it seems the league is in any case fighting
a losing battle this year.  The increased offense thus far will certainly 
spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly.

Major League Baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter
attention spans (i.e. the football crowd). (-:  Invariably, all the
arguments from people who don't like to watch baseball on T.V. say the
same thing:  the games are too long and too boring.  Baseball is trying
to find a way to shorten the games for wider T.V. appeal.  If you look at
it, though, baseball games last around the same amount of time as football
games.  The difference is that there is more action in that duration in
football games.  Perhaps if there were more action in baseball games, you
would get more of those fans to tune in.  Anyway, coming up with a solution
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.

I've had my Subaru Liberty 4WD station wagon for about 8 months now. Saying
I'm happy with it would be an understatement!

Just great. Well built, handles beautifully, plenty of power. I've only
had if 'off tar' once. Did a trip over the mountains on a narrow, windy
dirt road, often _very dodgey_ in parts. The Subaru did it with ease.
I havent had so much fun driving a car for years!

The European version is called 200 SX and have a 1.8 liter engine with
turbo and have more power than the US version ( 169 HP ); it goes from
0 to 100 Km/h in 7.5 sec and have a top speed of 225 Km/h ( 140 miles/h ).
I just purchased one ( new ) and I am looking for a repair book. I could
not find one in FRANCE and GERMANY; does anybody knows where to find one ?
Is there one in the UK ?
Probabaly no use to look in the US as the 240 SX have here a different motor.
I am very pleased with the car and have no problem with it; but like to have
good technical documentation about the car I own.

A friend had a Ford Taunus (era early 60's) that *did* have a V4 in it.

I lost a bet on it. I find it hard to believe there are no *recent* cars

Summary: Any way to remove fine scratches in clear coat?
Keywords: clear coat paint

Lines: 27

Is clear coat really worth it?  Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars
have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs
that aren't clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clear
coated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has
fine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.

Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed.
When I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember
from a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car
to the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my
car.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof
(which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before
he dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a
haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light
hits the roof at a particular angle.

I am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any 
chance of getting the dealership to do something about this?
My guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that provides
a solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect of
having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches?
Information, commiseration, and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .

Rogers is the one-batter lefty in the bullpen.  Dusty has also said he
trusts Rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where Beck is
unavailable, so you might see a couple of saves for Kevin.  Then again, if
any of the regular rotation falters, Rogers is a possible candidate to
start, though this would appear less likely now that Dave Burba did well
in an emergency start.

One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and
noticed 2 out on the road. As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at 
my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire
fence. Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to 
untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. As I pulled up next to him
(seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the Goat had
vanished (into the field I guess).

While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently  
when I bought a new truck.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  
agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax
and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  
When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  
get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  
started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  
miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  
another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  
their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  
brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  
reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  
treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  
deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  
snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  
the turn of events.

Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  
to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  
asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  
that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  
that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  
and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  
pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  
lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  
him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.

A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  
apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  
knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  
it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  
and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....

I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  
decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  
back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  
truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  
incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  
there in my new truck in about 30 mins.

So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  
have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  
person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  
sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  
mistake.

Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  
dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  
I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.

After a tip from Gary Crum (crum@fcom.cc.utah.edu) I got on the Phone
with Pontiac Systems or Pontaic Customer Service or whatever, and
inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and
Trans Am.  BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me
nowhere.  After being routed to a Firebird Specialist, I was able
to confirm that this is in fact the case.

At first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.
She wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some
shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they
simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she
was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,
feel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.

Second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related
to the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is
a production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was
not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore
having to wait for the right high quality parts...  I'm not positive
that this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would.

Can anyone else shed some light on this?

Oh, yea, and Chris Bosio pitched a NO-HITTER.  One over the minimum, two
bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches.  I listened
to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a
real treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone is
better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me).

But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have 
been a different story :-)

Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in
Major League baseball ....  Pretty impressive in any league.

Man, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a 
really interesting team to follow this year.  Also, John Cummings (rookie)
has had three solid outings with no support.  If Fleming comes back 
this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year
(relief is another story, though - grimace).

Too cool.  The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from 
start to end.  And again, I think Niehaus will win some kind of award
for the way he called the game.  The guy is truly a joy to listen to --
he deserves a pennant race ...

In many of our cities, there are traffic signals every 100 feet (unsynchronised,
of course (well here in Ottawa anyway)) and the roads are so congested that 
shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot.  Also, most Canadians are
too stupid to learn how to shift manually (gee, I gotta co-ordinate my two
feet on the clutch, brake _and_ accelerator, and I gotta steer, shift _and_
operate the signals (optional) and radio with my two hands... duh... it 
can't be done).  Also, most North American made cars come with the automatic 
as standard equipment, so why bother with a manual when the car can shift 
for you for no addition money.

funny, it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks,
which are nothing BUT collections of statistics, are authored by bill james
and stats inc. (and howe, for the minor league handbook).

and i am not sure how the 1993 bill james player ratings book qualifies
as a book with statistics, while the elias analyst is a statistics book.
the analyst contains more stats, sure, but it also contains more dialogue.

finally, the point was not about the word statistics.  it was about
money-grubbing.  i don't see how anyone who has looked at the bill
james player ratings book cannot consider him money-grubbing.

Hello,
 
I have a 92 Toyota 4X4 and in the last few weeks I have been getting quite
a few dings :( in the paint on the hood from rocks and debris off of the
road. I have never had any major problems with other car/trucks in the past
(maybe a ding once in a while). I went to the dealer and he said that it
happens all of the time and he recomended putting a bug deflector on the
hood. He said that the trucks, for some unknown reason, seem to have this
problem more than some cars.? 

It seems to me that either my luck is really bad or there might be a problem
with the paint (painted on a monday morning perhaps?). 
 
How well do these bug deflectors work for small road debris on trucks? 
 
If anyone has any experiences/suggestions please let me know, thanks.

True 914 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this
but I'll dump my impressions.  I've wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years
now; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake
of my life!)

Anyway, for $4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set
in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit.
The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the
engine and passenger compartment.  Also look for chassis welded together
here.  Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger;
a 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.

Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you
can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too.

The machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild
washer instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good
bug/porsche mechanic would be easy.  Since it is mid-engine you may spend
more on labor for any mechanical work.

This was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game. The
argument was

1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.
2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.

3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and
earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%
of defense and pitching is 88% of defense.
4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.

Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in
the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and
pitching.

>One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the

I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or
even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and
even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot
more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often. (No offense,
Gordon).

In addition to restricted mileage, many classic insurance carriers also require

While your 0-60 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, I saw
the PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5-speed SL2 at 7.9 seconds.  I'm sure that most
SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still
astonishingly fast for a small 4-door.  A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds
0-60, if I'm not mistaken.  Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the
9-second range.

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not
actually using the Valentine-1.  I'd like to give some feedback based on
real life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode
and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does
is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes
sense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different
directions.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its
reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.

I have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case
there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I
passed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then
the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With
other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.
But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there
was another trap.  And there was!

On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from
a true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator
changes.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where
the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the 
place.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector
that leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the
car passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would
have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar
trap when there was none.

I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features
to be useful and not gimmicks.

	Sure they might. If an error is recorded on, for example, a
ground ball, ie the batter would otherwise be out, it is officially a
hitless at bat. If it's some other type of error (Greenwell lets a
single go by), it doesn't effect the OBP. But, most errors are

>Some evidence that is NOT working:

Take a look at the standings. It's REAL easy to get so focussed on 
minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place. If it's
working, you don't SCREW IT UP by changing things, just because you think it
ought to be different.

Some folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams
win. When the Giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange
the batting order. Until then, I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong,
for the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS.

>P.S.  Does the mailing list maintainer think that Will Clark is the best

In the majors? I don't follow AL, so I won't comment on Majors. In the NL,
if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it'd be Clark, and
I'd hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, because
I've never been able to GET Clark. I'd take any of the three without
hesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it).

Williams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn't
headcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops
to .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest
Baseball Weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296.
That's not exactly chopped liver.

Mostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that
continues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy. But evidently,
some folks would rather be right than be first.

  Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS
that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power
burst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also
had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a 
bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the
time. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear
in the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was 
NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of slip device in the shaft
to prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!

  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane
do a stoppy(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike 
up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these
activities anymore (now that I'm an old guy with kids of my own) but
it looked damn impressive!!

  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed
in that direction! :-)

Check your facts....Andre dawson's career Slugging pct is in the .480's
So is Winny's I would like to see your facts. Winny has probably done  
better than 129 points above with a carrer SLG of 480. Check on more  
important stats. DEFENSE, and HEART. BATTING AVERAGE. RBI's

Peak, and career, especially career, Winny ranks in the top 15 outfielders  
of all time. You are using BS to make your standings. And I would like to  
know where you are getting your numbers from.

Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I 
would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The
older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would
assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some
if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.

Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study.
My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have
independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and
more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The
independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy
the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second
difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm
not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive
system. The older Landcruisers have a lock-up type. Both have their
advantages and disadvantages.

I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also. I finally 
decided to just have my drain plug welded shut. It works great !
I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light
comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than
the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every 3000 miles.
Works for me, I must say.

If your Viper system were tuned like a neighbor's is you wouldn't get
any sleep because of the damn thing waking every one in the neighborhood
up.

We all used to try to ignore the alarm, but have now made a pact to
bombard the house with night-time visits and phone calls when ever we
are awakened because some thunder storm passed over the next county
or a stray dog looked at the car.

Car alarms are a serious pain-in-the-ass!

I don't have a history handy, but I don't recall that the preponderance
of ROY's come from winning teams.  In fact, I think team performance is
generally irrelevant, as almost always the most deserving candidate wins.
Am I wrong?

And he is not necessarily on a losing team.  While the Angels' staff
is still very weak, their everyday lineup is doing quite well, thank
you.  Snow is playing great.  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments.
Easley appears fine, but even if he's not Flora is ready to come up.
Between Gonzales and Gruber they'll manage the hot corner.  Polonia
and Curtis are steady and heady.  Even Myers and Orton are contributing.

Personally, I think they can finish over .500 which makes them a 
winning team.

Seriously, though, putting a helmet on a mirror is inadvisable because
you are then resting the weight of the helmet on the fragile foam
liner that is expected to cushion your noggin.  And once crushed, that
foam never pops back.

A variation of mirror hanging thing is what I do; with the bike on the
sidestand (hey, the centerstand is for maintenance) I turn the wheel to
the stop (left) and can hang the helmet by the chin-bar on the right
grip.  There is no crushable foam in the chin-bar, and it is pretty
secure on there (as long as the forks are locked).  If I have to leave
the helmet with the parked bike (and the bags aren't on/full), that is
about the most stable place.

	That I did not do; however, the sample bolt I took to the store fit
rather well in the following:  1/2 open end wrench, 1/2 box end wrench, 1/2
12-point normal socket.  I take that as meaning it's a 1/2 bolt head.

  It wasn't that the Lawson's V&H OWO1 was faster.  If you watch the tape

Beware.  The original poster looks to be from Louisville, and chances are  
Louisville gets the edition of the NYTimes that is printed in Chicago for the

Put the pack on the pillion and bungee it to the backrest.
If that is not possible then you should be able to bungee it behind the
backrest, just make sure it doesn't bend or break anything like the rear

Unfortunately, you seem to lack the ability to rate players.  Dave
Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of
Fame.  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players
of all time.  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career
of any relief pitcher since 1960, with the possible exception of Gossage.

On the other hand, Kingman probably isn't one of the best 750 players
of all time.

And Reardon, though a good pitcher, isn't in Smith's class career wise.

We're talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here.  There probably

Garvey sucked.  Morris, while a very good pitcher, simply doesn't
belong near Cooperstown.

 Gee, can these guys even compare to
>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?

If Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be 
marginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for
a while longer)

To put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights
values of the careers of the players you mention.  In parenthesis
is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it.
While no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give
you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.

Robin Yount 43.0 (41)
Ozzie Smith 42.1 (45)
Dave Winfield 40.3 (53)
Eddie Murray 37.5 (68)
Darrel Evans 35.2 (80)
Kirby Puckett 24.3 (180)
Nolan Ryan 21.6 (219)
Jack Morris 11.8 (478)
Dave Kingman 0.4 
Steve Garvey -5.8

To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall:
Of the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0, 64 are in the Hall
of Fame. The ones who aren't include 4 19th century players, Ron Santo, Bobby
Grich, and Bob Johnson.

Of those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9, 15 of 25 are in.  Of
those eligible who score between 25.0 and 29.9, 24 of 44 are in.

Let's see how the weather is Saturday or Sunday. It sucks

You're welcome to give any of the ones I have a try.  As
for the gargoyles, if you want mine you can have 'em.  I
think the bridge of my nose holds them too far from my face.
Same deal for the two of my friends who tried them. For
people who use them with a full face helmet, all bets are
off. Sorry if they fit you well and took my complaint
personally. Yes the Oakleys are much more desirable squid
attire. Also the gargoyles aren't that ugly, even in my
opinion, or I wouldn't have tried them.

The best thing to do is to get a full face, even if it is a
cheap brain bucket.  I didn't think a full face was important
until I took a gnarly spill and ended up sliding 20 feet on my

Was going over some videos last night.....

Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very
interesting.  And enlightening.

Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,
circa June 1986.

1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,
    not gain more bulk.

2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's
    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.

3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is
    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -
    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,
    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing.

What would I do, if I were Jose?

Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,
so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.

First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this
will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely.

Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.

Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find
my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling
the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength
 is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park.

If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could
still hit 600+ HR.

The events I saw were:
1)  Called strike by Hirschbeck
2)  Shocked-looking Gant asks for appeal to first
3)  No appeal to first
4)  Gant steps out of batters box.
5)  Hirschbeck *immediately* orders Gant back in.  [bad move]
6)  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off. [bad move]
7)  Hirschbeck yells at Gant.  Gant is silent.
8)  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch.
9)  Pitch is called a strike.
10)  Cox argues (couldn't see when he came on the field)
11)  Cox is ejected, players everywhere
12)  Play finally resumes.

Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck.  Not returning made the strike
call fairly likely.  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten
Gant tossed altogether.  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out, the
whole incident probably would have been avoided.

I don't understand the fascination with vent windows. They create a tremendous 
turbulence and noise that makes even a simple connversation impossible at 
speeds above 40mph. The current flow-throuh ventilation, if designed right, 
are far more superior.

I've been saying this for quite some time, but being absent from the
net for a while I figured I'd stick my neck out a bit...

The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL
team since the inception of the DH rule.  (p.s. any ideas what this is?)

They will fall easily short of 600 runs, that's for damn sure.  I can't
believe these media fools picking them to win the division (like our
Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of
genius for the trades/aquisitions he's made)

Ryan> Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not.

This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing
layers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.
Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner
compacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or
delaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years
following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose
up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have
a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.

Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and
other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the
comfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously
degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of
parking your lid on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the
comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly
damaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.

did come out of nowhere, but some of the improvement was

OK, OK, OK. First, my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request, but here goes anyhow:

I'm *very* interested in finding out how I might be able to get two tickets for the All Star game in Baltimore this year. My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game. I went with them, and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child, to the All Star game in DC many years ago. Although I'm now in the SF Bay Area, I'd *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game; it's absolutely the last chance they'd ever have to attend this g




ame locally.

Any info would be greatly appreciated!!!!

I watched the final inning of Bosio's no-hitter with several people at
work. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he
wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles
by about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out
think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.
Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And
if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an
error or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced
past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether
Vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.

Brake rotors and the clutch are the main things.  There has been a clutch 
replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible, 
as it is a change well worth making.  You can also swap the cruddy cable 
shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll 
cost you some $$.

My brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably 
normal.  Didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting.

What kind of tires does the car have on it?

Sounds more like an Opel GT.  Neat cars, fun to drive.  Sold through
Buick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly).  I believe it
was in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts
were not interchangeable with the older models.  Parts are thus much
harder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are not
too difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff
including a brand new (not remfg) long block.  Either a GT or a
Kharman Ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.

But of course, it is expected that umpires will show up players.

Don't get me wrong, I understand the nature of the game, but I just 
believe that a little ego-ectomy for the umpires would make the game 
much better.

   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.


I know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the
things that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I've
heard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto
Guzzis and other relative exotics since there isn't a large demand
for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems
that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes.

I was at that game, behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the 
radar gun.  The 1991 season was winding down and Roger didn't have his 
best fastball, topping out at 88-90 (in contrast to Frank Tanana, who went 
as low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out Phil 
Plantier *five* times on the night).  Inky's shot would have gone further
than any I've ever seen if it hadn't crashed *into* the lights (not the 
lightstand) as you say over 100 feet high, Roy Hobbs-like, and bounced 
back onto the field.  That had to have been a 525-footer if unobstructed,
edging out Bo Jackson's drive off Oil Can Boyd to the top of the
centerfield bleacher back wall in 1988 for the best I've seen personally 
(I was sitting under that one).

Also, Alomar got a FAR greater boost from his home park than Baerga did from 
his. And six or seven home runs? Hmm.

So, if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in Toronto, you'd take 
Alomar. Anywhere else, and you'd probably take Baerga.

After a quick start, Pena has been stuck in a rut.  Torre gave Alicea
the start to try to get Pena out of whatever funk he is in.  It has

not a flame, just a point:  I'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel
_I_  or my car couldn't handle it, but because of exactly what you said:
drivers who are STUPID.  Like the ones who are doing 130 also, and so
they pull in right behind you at maybe 1-2 car lengths....oh yeah, real
smart...  This scares me in cities at 50.  When i can't see enough of
the car to make it recognizable, they are following TOO CLOSE.  And 
when i see them doing this AND reading a newspaper.....*sigh*...this
is why America has 55-65 speed limits: our drivers are TOO DUMB to realise
that reading the paper should be done at breakfast, or work, not in their
car.

are you serious? pitchers are pinch-hit for in the nl.  they are not in the
nl.  if a pitcher is cranking in the al, he will stay in the game.  if he
is cranking in the nl, he may not - ESPECIALLY if it's a pitchers' duel,
and his team needs an extra run.

So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.


1) Zane Smith should learn how to switchpitch and return from the DL. I
would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.

2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an
impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's
reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the
AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he
pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.

3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.
BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.
Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at
the plate in his rookie year.

4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that
Walk desrved his contract.

5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I
can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through
waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.
Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught
should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed
pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to
trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere
wasn't very fit last year.

6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!
7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the
season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other
than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,
Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have
pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money
on Patterson in stead.

8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.

9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.
10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his
value has increased immensely.

11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.
Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.
Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better
than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.

12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement
in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.
13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The
RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace
two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a
very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have
a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit
left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options
for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was
getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.

14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.
they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.
Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,
nothing else will.

On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2
starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of
the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the
season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked
in the second half of the last 2 seasons)>

I've ridden one twice. It was designed to be a monster in a straight line,

Lack of build quality was the thing  I notced on the first 2 LH's I
saw months back. The panel gaps were large and non-uniform between
the 2 cars I saw - the kind of thing you expect and accept on a
Mustang - but not from Chrysler's savior.  I drove one of the low
end cars, and thought it was more than adequate. I'd prefer
an LH to a Taurus from my brief experience.

Better still, years ago they demonstrated a cold air system which only used

They light the highways in Texas?  Funny, everywhere else I've been
they only light 'em at junctions.

I won't even get into how much road markings vary between states and
localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are
essentially nonexistant.

I suspect you have very limited experience -- US freeways vary
dramatically, particularly between states.  I can name a number of
interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be
very optimistic in any car.

I'm not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations
but I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be
considered so.  They're hard to take at 85mph.  That's not the only
interstate I've seen with such deviations, but it's one I drive
frequently.

Texas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can't assume that everywhere
has roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such
wide-open spaces.  It just ain't so.

>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?

I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.

Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on
his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I
actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.

I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and
rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to
invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then
I also passed my road test.

On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a
4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),
I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,
skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the
oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was
also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under
a car and been killed.

Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the
Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training
could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater
since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff
as I did.

So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I
wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you
happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until
you're ready to use it.

>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have 
>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too 
>ignorant to know I need to buy)

While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in
DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you
save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,
plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure
the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up
machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration
and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not
including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.

>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up

I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200
in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial
coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be
poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo
more expensive.

>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?

There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle
magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or
recent models might be available.  You could probably look through
past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first
bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice
instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that
are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by
noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around
and they were generally set up the way I wanted.

Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting
showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,
were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and
quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence
cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.

If I hear someone screwing with my car (ie, setting off the alarm) and
taunting me to come out, you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite
will also be coming with me. It's not the screwing with the car that'd
get them shot, it's the potential physical danger. If they're
taunting like that, it's very possible that they also intend to rob
me and/or do other physically harmful things.

If they're just screwing around, no harm done. If they're bent on
mayhem, they will receive the cure for their lead deficiency; a

Still, if the 'whispers' reached San Francisco, it is certainly possible they

Uh, the original author's point was that black and white players were por-
trayed differently by the media, and towards this, he gave a highly selected
list to prove his case. Sanders' name showed up eventually. I dispute that
Sanders has ever been called lazy by the media.

Uh, that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first. It is NOT a
quibble, then, to state that the media did not portray Canseco as being 
lazy. If the other person chooses to so accuse him, after my post, that does not
make it a quibble. And in fact, the media around here tend(ed) to play up his

Well, Canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed
record, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence. 
Clemens had a run-in at a bar. Canseco had that, as well, and in both cases, the
coverage was relatively minimal.

I dunno, on my old GS1000E the tank-seat junction was nice and smooth.
But if you were to travel all the way forward, you'd collect the top

Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much
as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning
the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that
this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win
in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first
instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch
it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.

I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against 
visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the
field.

Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or
not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his
first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.

Well, it looks like I'm F*cked for insurance.

I had a DWI in 91 and for the beemer, as a rec.
vehicle, it'll cost me almost $1200 bucks to insure/year.

Now what do I do?

Insurance companies sure seem to go for No-Fault coverage.  Since the
majority of accidents are the cagers' fault, doesn't this imply that we
would have to pay much higher rates under a No-Fault system?

With a cars-only system, it seems to make sense on the surface: take the
legal costs out of the system.  But it looks like motorcyclists would
get screwed.

I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.

The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If
Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold
at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than
Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double.)

Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No
team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players
than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 1950's for all teams.  

Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon
Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with
38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by Runs Created.

If you do make it into New York state, the Palisades Interstate Parkway is a
pleasant ride (beautiful scenery, good road surface, minimal traffic).  You
may also want to take a sidetrip along Seven Lakes Drive just off the parkway
for the same reasons plus the road sweeps up and down along the hills with
sweeping turns under old forest canopy.

I would prefer a picture with you in it.  Since most motorcycles don't post,
and are rather similar looking (i.e all R100S's are more alike than they are
different), it is the people that are ultimately more interesting.

It works for me. I avoid obscenities, and try to remain calm cool and 
collected, and try something like, You almost just killed me, and I'm not 
moving until you apologize. or something more or less benign like that. I 
haven't been shot a single time, but I don't do it in Texas, and I do only 
do it when there are plenty of witnesses around.

One of the things that police dogs are used for is to

As Charles said, many people are scared of dogs and will
panic when one goes on attack.  They will then turn their 
weapon on the dog and this allows the police officer to
take control.

bleagh! this was a terrific trade.  snow will certainly be better than

the game today.

>2.  Wade Boggs.

i'm not sure about this one.  i think that it's good, in that a
pre-1992 boggs kicks hayes/meulens/whoevers' ass, and that a 1992
boggs still isn't ALL that shabby.  it's bad, though, that the
yankees expect a pre-1992 boggs, and will probably get a 1992 boggs.
however, i'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam.

>3.  Spike Owen.

you have my full agreement here.  he's not all that much better than
velarde, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him.
however, i do enjoy the fact that spike is not a nickname.
not that this helps the yankees.

i strongly disagree.  i'd much much rather have a hundred games of

No, currently there's no room for him in the rotation.  Key is having
a Most Impressive April.  Abbott is pitching well.  Perez is back.
Wickman has pitched his way into the rotation, and is holding his spot
with an outstanding performance his last time out.  And Kamieniecki
isn't doing too poorly himself.

If the Yankees find themselves in need of a starter, Militello will
get another chance.  Until then, he'll have to wait in line.

IF I were the vandal, and I really hated someone, maybe someone who knew
something about cars, of course I would look for ANY types of valves I could
undo.  Especially, special oil drain plugs, and radiator petcocks.

As well as putting bad things in the gas...

be the 'time bomb' approach, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks

     It depends on which uniforms you are talking about.  For the last
couple of years I believe Toronto and Pittsburgh has used the same uniforms,
or at least very similar.  The home jerseys had the team nick name
(Blue Jays or Pirates), but the road jerseys had the name of the city
(Toronto or Pittsburgh).  I believe this is the way most teams design
their uniforms.

What is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to
AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.
If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero
dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching
the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.
Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very
concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in
protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I
think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a
difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go
somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)
you can just detach and stow the pants. 

One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for
many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and
petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. 

Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I
got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not
really that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must
be).

Your speculation that the two proven veterans will produce better
than Lopez is also no more than speculation.  It *does* make
a difference whether the speculation is well-founded or not.

Though this is a good point.  The one speculation is safer,

 I have been looking at buying a 1989 Jeep Laredo and was wondering
if anyone had any bad or good experiences with this model. Is it
all that much different than the other YJs? 

 It looks, feels and sounds like a nice vehicle even thought the
price is rather steep for an '89 (12K Canadian).

There's a strong possibility that the Bucs have absolutely no other catching  
prospects in the minors at this point -- at least nobody ready for any serious  
AAA/majors duty.  The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be  
just age, especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mid-30s or something.
 
All things considered, though, I'd be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind  
the plate than Prince.  Isn't there decent backup backstop out there looking  
for work?

I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about 
fighting my ticket.

Many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your 
case in court.  Others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge 
about the circumstances surrounding your ticket, while one fellow lost
because the judge just didn't appear to be in the mood for such foolishness.

Several of you suggested that I obtain a book called Fight Your Ticket.

The general theme from those who said go for it, was to be prepared.  
I should do as much research as possible, go back and review the scene, 
transcribe what happened to tape or paper, use any witnesses that may 
have been around, have a list of questions to ask the cop and/or the judge,
and to be positive and assertive.  I am innocent until proven guilty! <gulp>

A few people suggested trying to get my court date changed, as this might 
trip up the arresting officer, he may not show up if the date is on his day
off or if he feels/knows that he doesn't have a chance to win against you.

One individual stated that an Officer could be an Expert Witness, and if he
says I was speeding, then by damn, I was speeding.

Another says that I must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun.

Lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all.  I'll let you know what
happens after the big day!

On a cold, damp night last night at Tiger Stadium, Dave Wells, David Haas, Bob 
MacDonald, and Mike Henneman combined for a 3-1 victory over the Texas
Rangers.  Here are the highlights:


            R     H     E
Texas       1     4     1
Detroit     3     5     0

Wells gets the win, he's now 3-0 with an ERA just under 1, and Henneman gets
his third save in three chances.  Ken Rogers started for the Rangers and 
gets the loss.  He was relieved by Burns in the 7th.

The Rangers got their only run on a solo home run by Dean Palmer in the 7th.
The Tigers opened the scoring with an RBI single by Fryman in the 3rd, then
took the lead for good in the bottom of the seventh when Whitaker greeted
reliever Burns with an RBI double which scored Tettleton.  Whitaker in turn
crossed the plate on an RBI single by Phillips (who has been red hot) for 
the third Tiger run.

This afternoon, it's another battle of southpaws, Bill Krueger for the Tigers
vs. Craig Lefferts for the Rangers.

--Randy

p.s.  Toronto Blue Jay fans, thanks for Wells and MacDonald!  Those guys
have really been a big help to the Tigers pitching staff!

Personally, i wouldn't use the $1.29 product from KMart. I knew about
this previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss 
(their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends
not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).

Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture
from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the 
others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber 
components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well
with water to help remove it from the fuel system.

I use a product recommended by VW called 44K (by BG Products, Inc.).
It cost more about $14.00, but it is supposed to do the job without
the potential harmful side effects, and its results are supposed to 
last from 2k to 4k miles. I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene (sp?).

I can't say that i have noticed any difference using either, since i 
only use these product as a preventative maintenance item.

I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis
on which to make this argument, but don't you answer your own
question?  Is the reflected signal shifted at all from the
act of being reflected?  If so, wouldn't it then be easy for
the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct
sources?

Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat
shaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three
picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning
and blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).

Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leading
hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young
and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.

In the past few years I have owned 3 Mustang GTs and now own a 91 T-Bird SC. 
They all have had this problem. There was a recall on the T-bird for the brake 
problem. The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp 
after about 10K miles. Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on 
the T-Bird I'll never buy a Ford again.

The Phillies salvaged their weekend series against the Chicago Cubs
by beating them 11-10 in a wild one at Wrigley Field Sunday
afternoon.  It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and
was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young
season.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2
John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny
Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.
Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4,
however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In
the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year
to push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the
11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when
the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of
position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the
game.

The Phils bring their league leading 9-3 record back to action
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday against the Padres.

It depends. If, in the judgment of the umpire the batter made no
attempt to avoid getting hit, the batter is awarded first for a
base on balls. If the umpire rules he did try to get out of the
way, he's awarded first because of a hit batsman.

Someone in SABR actually looked at these games a few years ago 
and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one 
of the games - even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly 
(allowing 4 or 5 runs).

On the subject of the V4,Ford in the UK used V4 engines exstensively in
their Ford Transit vans.This brings back a memory from the seventies.I
played in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of
us bought a 1967 tranny to cart the gear around in.It was in terrible
shape (cosmetically) because it's last owner was a pig farmer.We spent
days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til
the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried
pig shit came flying out the vents!!!.
    Back to the engine if I remember right it was a 1600cc V4 and that
thing could haul,we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and
it went like a bat out of hell,of course there were no pollution controls
on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now.
    When the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a 
Morris Minor that worked great. Ah fond memories.

   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed
side 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but
it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.

Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow.

The year after Iceland also changed.

About cars: Before the H-day (H as in Hoegertrafik. hoeger is
Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had
the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side. :-)

More contries that uses the left side is:

Japan
Tanzania (I think)
New Zeeland
How about South Africa?

BTW. Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe
and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)

A friend of mine (who's probably reading this right now) just bought a new
Yamaha Virago 750.  After spending 1-2 hours very late one chilly evening
watching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg, loosen
the brake pedal, &c. &c.) I've pretty much decided never to get this
particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil/filter
for me.  Compared to the 5-minute change he was used to for his Honda, this
is just a design flaw/oversight in my eyes.

Yes, yes, yes.  Motorcycling is slightly different to each and every one of us.  This
is the nature of people, and one of the beauties of the sport.

And what view exactly is it that every single rider of cruiser bikes holds, a veiw

 Whacha mean 'we'...ifin they (whom ever 'they' are) want to stereotype me

  If you were refering 'stereotype' to infer a negative - you noticed we

	Strictly from memory, I think the Phillies were something like
	ten games up with 12 to go, lost 10 in a row, and 11 of last 12
	to lose to the Cardinals. Seems impossible, but thats how I
	remember it. I also felt at the time that Johnny Callison of
	the Phillies lost the MVP as a by-product of their swoon.

There was an article in one of the U.K. dailies this week
about a soccer goalkeeper who had to be carried off the
field after a collision with a Ford Sierra cage.

Seems the cage driver wanted to turn around, but needed to
drive onto the pitch to do this, so he waited till the ball
and most of the players were up the other end. Unfortunately,
as soon as he started his manouvre someone booted the ball back down
the pitch, the goalkeeper ran backwards towards his goal, straight
into the cage!

Ford tried that also, back in 1983.  My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at
the end of the turn-signal stalk, instead of in the center of the wheel where
God intended it to be. :-)  I drove two different cars then (the other an

Well maintained chains, running in oil, without those little rubber 'O' rings 
to cause frictional losses, might reach 99% efficiency.  The average open to 
the dust 'O' ring motorcycle chain probably has a difficult job making 90% 
efficient.

My favorite was the Barry Foote homer that bounced on Waveland and through
a second floor window across the street.  Second though, would be the Kong

It depends on how badly you want to live.  The FAA says eight hours, bottle
to throttle for pilots but recommends twenty-four hours.  The FARs specify
a blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, I think, which is more than
twice as strict as DWI minimums.

BTW, alcohol metabolizes in your blood at a fixed rate -- one beer/hour will
keep your blood/alcohol level barely street-legal.  Coffee, hyperventilation
and other bar tricks won't speed it up nor will they fool Mr. Ranger.

How about those toneau covers? I've been thinking of building one

mileage in highway travel?

I agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific
argument.  That has great hands means nothing.  It seems to me that
a first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily)
from his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  How many such
chances does he get during a game?  Many fewer than he gets chances
to catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is
much higher than Grounder/Popup totals).  This implies to me that there
is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line
or in the dirt.  Good Hands are needed for such plays, and thus have
value.  I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences
of these plays, but I'd guess that the values of these abilities are
similar.  It's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily
on how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose).

Let's try WEEKS! It is April 18th today and I just finished reading posts
regarding the Cleveland Indians boating tragedy. Needless to say, I don't want
to read partial linescores of games played 3 weeks ago.

As Charles mentioned (I excluded the quote): Join a mailing list if you want to

plug on and read the rest of the posts about spring training...

  I really think that this is the key point.  When I saw the incident on
Baseball Tonight Sunday, I couldn't believe how far away from the plate
Gant went.  Then he casually leaned against his bat.  I don't blame the 
umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.

  The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the
field.  What were they going to do, attack the umpire?  The only people
who should've been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches, but NO players.
I agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for
having no control over his team.

That reminds me of one of Texas's ads...you hear a guy speaking in
French (like it's a letter home), then the French moves to the 
background, and a French-accented voice come to the foreground, talking
about how he went walking on the beach, and it felt so much like
home that he decided to take his shoes off...and the rest of his
clothes. It ended with please send bail. :-)

I normally have an unloaded Colt Delta in my glove box with a loaded
magazine handy (which is perfectly legal in Oklahoma). For those
times that I'm travelling inter-state, I keep an unloaded 
S&W .44 Magnum revolver in the glove box, with a speed-loader
in my pocket (which is legal everywhere, under Federal law, Illinois
State Police be hanged).

As I've said before, this is stricly for defense; my insurance
will pay to replace my car, but I only have one life...

Since everyone else seems to be running wild with predictions, I've
decided to add my own fuel to the fire:
They might seem a bit normal, but there are a few (albeit, small) surprises.

American League East	 W	 L	GB
1)New York Yankees	93	69	--
2)Baltimore Orioles	90	72	 3
3)Toronto Blue Jays	86	76	 7
4)Cleveland Indians     84      78       9

NL MVP-Barry Larkin
NL Cy Young-John Smoltz
NL Rookie of the Year-Wil Cordero
NL Manager of the Year-Joe Torre
NL Comeback Player of the Year-Eric Davis

NL Champions-St. Louis Cardinals
AL Champions-Minnesota Twins
World Champions-St. Louis Cardinals

The St. Louis picks are what my heart says.
What my brain says, is they will win the division, lose to the Braves
in the NLCS, and the Braves will win the Series against Minnesota.
But for now, I'll stick with the Cards all the way.

I would guess the high price of gas in Europe (compared to the US) has
always favoured 4-cylinder manuals.

small engines with autos are a real bore...

But why not turn the question around, why are automatics so common in
the US?

My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torque-rich
V8's in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to 
use both feet to depress, and that this has just lived on.

And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime.
That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you
want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the
only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who
witnesses a crime can do so.

Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a
description of the car and the license number, and tell them the
specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
(ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill
out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any
ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to
appear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight
as a cop's.

	Actually, this started as a great idea.  Before steering-column

in reverse, remove the key, and the car *stays* in reverse!
	Also, suppose you get into your car, and a thug comes up and
demands your keys at gunpoint.  You hand them over, he gets in, and
HAS NO IDEA WHERE TO PUT THE KEY!  At this, he will run away (or perhaps
shoot you anyway  %-}).  I heard this actually happened somewhere...

*cough* *choke*  WHAT?!?  if a cop gave me a ticket for sounding like
i was speeding i'd probably show up in court without a lawyer simply
because sounding like speeding is ridiculous.  if i was found guilty
i'd appeal and then show up with a lawyer.

if a cop doesn't do one of:

VASCAR (from car or plane)
RADAR, LIDAR, other electronic speed measuring device
pace me

and i'm within 15mph or so of the limit i'd go to court.  i can accept a
cop seeing me going excessively fast (like 25+ over the limit) but
he looked like he was going 70 or so in a 55 zone is not beyond a
reasonable doubt.  granted i may well lose the case but 70 in a 55 measured
by eye???  take it to court for sure.

I had a similar experience.  We had a written quote which had been mailed
to us from the salesman at one of these no-haggle Toyota dealers for
a Camry XLE w/ABS, leather, etc.  The price seemed fair, but when we
went in to take them up on their offer, they discovered that certain
extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote.
It would have totaled an extra $1100 and, in spite of the fact that we
had a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do.

Bottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that
the Toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they
don't have to deal.  We walked, went out and bought a new LH car
(Eagle Vision TSI) and I don't regret it one bit!

Actually, Gaetti's first year with California was 1991.  His .632 DA wasn't
out of line with his career averages, and his .616 was actually below average
in 1988.  But check out the last three years at the Metrodome.

1990
Gaetti  .655
AL Avg  .604
1991
Pags    .744
Leius   .653
Al Avg  .620
1992
Leius   .680
AL Avg  .603

For the last three years, the highest DAs in either league have been posted
by Minnesota players -- three different ones, including one (Pags) who was
mediocre to horrible elsewhere.  That doesn't *prove* a park effect is at
work, any more than San Diego's horrible infield numbers prove a park effect
is at work.  But it looks like a strong possibility to me.

It's a make before break type of switch.  If not required, it ought to be
for high-low beams.  

There might be a wee problem with this.  If you use both filaments at the
same time, the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal.
Possibly enough to shorten it's life span.  My Honda CRX cage [a cage that
really wanted to be a bike] had wimpy stock lights.  So we used to run
around with both beams on.  Made a mucho big difference - until both low
beam filaments died nearly simultaneously!  This was two weeks after
finding out how nice it was to use both beams.  I replaced the lights with

>In defense of the drivers, who are in the right lane.  Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.  
>Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake
>cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  

just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?  It seems
to me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not need
to calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a little
more.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you
the car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should
let him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about,
about the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled
by drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem,
though, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault
for not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been.
Oddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my
liscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by
cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the
fact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with
them, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline
will do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything
over the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe
they should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....

just curious, and my .otwo

	Oh, lighten up.  What depresses me is that they might actually 
finish last, which I believe hasn't happened since their second season in 
1970.  Never mind that Gubizca is 0-2 with a 16.50 ERA, Gardner at 7.50,
our main recent acquisitions (Lind, McReynolds, Jose) are averaging .210,
David Cone is 0-2 (about how he was doing in KC before joining the Mets 
several years ago), our hitting sucks, and our pitching has collapsed, 
and we've won one game at home; they've won more games in their first ten
games than last year, and Brian McRae is actually batting over the 
Mendoza line!

	Dummy Hoy, a late 19th-Century baseball player, was deaf.  In
order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or
strike, the umpires developed hand signals.  This also helped to relieve
the stress on umpires' vocal cords, so they didn't have to shout STRIKE!!!

OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did
some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season. It turns
out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate, at least as
far as the Phillies record goes. On September 1 1964 this was the
top of the N.L. standings:

                 W     L    GB
Philadelphia    79    51    -
Cincinnati      74    57    5 1/2
St. Louis       72    59    7 1/2
San Francisco   73    60    7 1/2

This is a game-by-game description of the remainder of the Phillies'
season:

Date  Score Opponent        Lead      Pitcher (starting and winner/loser)
9/1   4-3   Houston         5 1/2     Bunning (15-4)
9/2   2-1   Houston         5 1/2     Short (15-7)
9/3   0-6   Houston         5 1/2     Bennett (9-12)

            (Cardinals back in sole possesion of 2nd place)

9/15  1-0   Houston         6         Bennett (12-12)
9/16  5-6   Houston         6         Bunning (17-5)

9/20  3-2   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Bunning (18-5)
            (Reds move back into tie for 2nd with Cardinals)

Well so far so good for the Phillies. But now it all falls apart ...

9/21  0-1   Cincinnati      5 1/2     Mahaffey (12-9)
            (Reds take sole possesion of 2nd place)
9/22  2-9   Cincinnati      4 1/2     Short (17-8)

            (Cards now 2 1/2 back in 3rd, Giants 3 1/2 in 4th)
9/26  4-6   Milwaukee         1/2     Mahaffey; Schantz (2-5)
9/27  8-14  Milwaukee      -1         Bunning (18-7)
            (Phils lose 7 1/2 games in 7 days; Reds take over 1st,
             Cardinals 1 1/2 back in 3rd)
9/28  1-5   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Short(17-9)
            (Cardinals take over 2nd place, Phils drop to 3rd)
9/29  2-4   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Bennett (12-14)
            (Reds and Cardinals now tied for 1st)
9/30  5-8   St. Louis      -2 1/2     Bunning (18-8)
            (Cardinals take 1/2 game lead over Reds)
10/1  4-3   Cincinnati     -1 1/2     Short; Roebuck (5-3)
            (Phillies halt 10-game losing streak; Cards lead Reds by 1/2 game)
10/2  Did not play; Cards lose to Mets, Reds tied for 1st, Phils 1 game back
10/3  10-0  Cincinnati     -1         Bunning (19-8)
            (Cards beat Mets, take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies)

Whew! what a finish! And the final standings were:

                 W     L    GB
St. Louis       93    69    -
Philadelphia    92    70    1
Cincinnati      92    70    1
San Francisco   90    72    3

Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short
were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of
the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which
time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the
Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at
that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one
of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of
the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched
a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It
would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the
year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.
Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1
through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than
the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that
stretch.

You got off cheap.  My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain
in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I
finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where
I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling
everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago,
signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...

Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street,
feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got
the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous
racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I
saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance...
Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and
someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with
a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid
up beside me and asked, Friend of yours, Steve?.  Shit, Matty,
it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!

Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet
before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him.
Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick.
While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed
to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty
minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty
presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror
and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack
and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the
bike.

I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly
afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty
told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went
uncontested.

	My GS came with XGT V4s and they are NOT all weather tires.  I took
out my right front bumper sliding on packed snow (not ice), before I learned
this fact.  I immediately bought XGT H4s which are definately all-weather.
A Carrera 4 I walk by everyday has XGT V4s on it even.  The Michelin dealer
where I bought my new tires said the V4s were made out of a different 
rubber that gets really hard and slick when the weather gets near feezing.  
Said he'd only try to sell me those tires during the winter if we were in
Texas and not Colorado.

Last year my nine year old son fell in love with baseball and now
likes to play and to follow the professionals.  I would like to buy
him a board game so he can catch a glimpse of and practise a little of
the managerial stragegy.  I am not looking for a computer game or any
type of game where manual dexterity determines the winner.  I am after
something that he and his friends can spread out over a table on a
rainy day and spend some thoughtful time over.

I would appreciate the names of any recommended games.  I don't follow
this newsgroup, so e-mail responses would be ideal.

An aquaintence has a 87 Accord.  The driver's side headrest was
accidentally put in backwards and has jammed.  According to the
dealer, the only way to get it out is to spend several hours
disassembling the seat.  This is the second time I have heard of this
happening, and I wonder whether there's an easier way to get the
headrest back out.  Has anyone else ever dealt with this problem?
Your advice would be appreciated!

Please email, and I will summarize if there is interest.

I rented an Oldsmobile Achieva (is that a yuppie name or what?) and a
Nissan Stanza.  They both had automatics.  I'm a manual transmission
bigot but I have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were
better shifters than I am.  And yes, they responded very quickly to
kickdown requests.  The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure
out which gear I was in.  (The Olds may have also, but I don't
remember.)  I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 50
mph when my foot told it, No I really want to accelerate quickly.

I would still prefer a manual, but I won't delude myself into thinking
that I can out-accelerate a modern automatic.  And I'm very smooth at
shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic.

On my LC (RZ to any ex-colonists) I replaced the bolt at the bottom of the barrel
with a tap. When I wanted a coffee I could just rev the engine until boiling
and pour out a cup of hot water.
I used ethylene glycol as antifreeze rather than methanol as it tastes sweeter.

  The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting 
Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire;
he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't
all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when
everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy
Campanella.

  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play
him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter.
Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez
will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they
play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching
tandem.

  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher
defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from
your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is
opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.
Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. 

  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big
bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that
they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard
plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak 
defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of
Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich
Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. 
I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.

Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at
the same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range.
How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget
allows, the Land Cruiser? 
Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.
Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance
when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually
make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the
on-road comfort.

If everything I've read is correct, Ford is doing nothing but re-
skinning the existing Mustang, with MINOR suspension modifications.
And the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job
of it.  

The new mustang, is nothing but a re-cycle of a 20 year old car.

I agree about the durability of the old TH400 trannies from GM.  While I 
never intentionally slamed my '68 Firebird 400 ci Conv. into gear, I would leave 
the trannie in Low (read 1st), grab hold, hit the pedal, and once the tires 
grabbed, take off.  When I reached about 57-60mph the turbo 400 Auto would 
shift to S (read 'super' or 2nd) and leave about 10 to 15 foot of double 
stripped rubber on the ground.  Most everyone I knew at the time was quite 
impressed with 'peeling' out at 60 MPH.  The trannie held up just fine.
Motor mounts would last about a year until I tied the motor down with large
chains.  Oh yea,FYI:    Pontiac 400 ci bored 0.04 over

My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached
the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that
I am forced to post :).  Anyone out there who might be
able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below,
please e-mail or post!

1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,
   there is usually a loud thunk from the rear of
   of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.
   What could cause this?  Is the differential going
   bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,
   and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,
   the sound is NOT something rolling around in the
   trunk!)  

2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from
   the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves
   going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the
   valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped?

3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable
   with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is
   relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to
   the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel
   spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes
   might help -- could anything else cause this?

4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting
   worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from
   3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more
   recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.
   Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put
   through all the gears and then back to park, as per
   Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.

5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have
   4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps
   in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are
   they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?

I'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners
out there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly,
these cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted
into taxis.  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a
junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be
junked.  About 60% of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most of
the rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and
Impalas (& Broughams).

I think he just wanted to get Henneman some work, because the

My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding
jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would
like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.

I'm considering two basic options:

1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs
    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.
    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact
    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates
    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.

2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new 
    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey
    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather
    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose
    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper
    than upper Aerostich.

Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other 
layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out 
lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, 
shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a 
reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would 
be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below
freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

Please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...

   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

I'd say this is a very bad idea - you should start out with something
much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head.
That particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of
thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.

Once you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do
something longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road
like Mines-Mt. Hamilton.

In any case, it's *your* (moral) responsibility to make sure that she
has proper gear that fits - especially if you're going sport
riding.

Pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick-off)
within 20 seconds after receiving the ball, not 15.

Pitchers are required to pitch their warm-up throws within a
one minute time frame, beginning after each half inning ends,
not two minutes.

And the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm-ups is
simple: Different mound, different catcher.

I'm pretty sure that Sandberg has done this at least once.  (I know someone

RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics.  You

I wondered the same thing.  When he first mentioned it, I thought he was
just making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in the
examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even
when only one league expanded.

So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues
because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making 
every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up
players that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.

Make sense?

Now *this* is a legitimate point.  Baseball is entertainment, and I have no
quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than
others, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of the
slug-bunt; I doubt it's a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of
it.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.

Of course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga's
inability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he isn't
paid to walk or is an RBI guy or whatever.

>And finally, I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 
>their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
>to them, than because they have a great eye

I'm not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becoming
convinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical
ability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the
chance to do it a lot.

Let's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether
they are power threats and whether they walk a lot:


			Power			No Power

	Patient		Frank Thomas		Brett Butler
			Barry Bonds		Ozzie Smith
			Mark McGwire		Craig Grebeck
			Babe Ruth		Miller Huggins
			Ted Williams		Billy Hamilton
			Rickey Henderson	Eddie Joost
			Joe Morgan		Mike Hargrove
			   .			   .
			   .			   .
			   .			   .

	Impatient	Ernie Banks		Ozzie Guillen
			Dave Kingman		Shawon Dunston
			Joe Carter		Andres Thomas
			George Bell		Jose Lind
			Kirby Puckett		Devon White
	etc.

As far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the
two are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at
the plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being
small of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of 
target at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;
he's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all
over the place, despite his huge strike zone.

Nobody is using discrete IC's to do these functions anymore if at

  Well, before we start calling the Engineering folks in France a bunch of

  My 1979 Mercury Capri had this lovely feature. This was not the earlier

While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar
information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..

I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)
after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, 
and Celica.

Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  

My criteria: a fun car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.
I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.
The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag.
Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS).
The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.
The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  
I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.
The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.
The Celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat
overpriced too) in non-turbo form.
I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it
for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.
I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.
Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)

The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its
reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:

My dislikes:
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.
Headlights have stuck up a few times (weather?)
air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.
crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)
parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).
assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not 
stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.
Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!
Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner.
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)
Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 

My Likes:
engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1
handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)
transmission (the 5 speed is a must)
usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)
Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)
stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)
low cowl (good visibility in front)
Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)
ABS/Air bag (see above)
rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)
No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)
Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't
have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling
point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  

The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed
much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the
Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.
If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find
that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
differently (if that's better is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass
around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about
the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.
Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so
I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  
I prefer cloth to leather anyway.  

I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume
that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the
Eagles (and I was really trying).  
There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT
has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm
rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch
but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.
And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!

Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the 
water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

Am I supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down? Just wondering.
I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially
for those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games
in their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other
countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. Also,
many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only
available through BBS's or some pay news services. By the way, mine is free
of charge and has no copyright restrictions.

>if you want to send updates and scores, set up a private mailing list
>and use that.

Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the
rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. Other than that, everything is done through
private e-mail. Currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that
branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. And the list
grows by an average of 35 people a day.

If people on USENET really don't want to see the postings I do to
rec.sport.baseball on a daily basis, please just let me know. If the response
is overwhelming against the posts, I won't do it anymore. 

Thanks for your time.

I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered
expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about
his batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his
back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open
stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque
(that's a paraphrase of what I remember).

In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide
his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure
himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.

Apparently, you sound like LaRussa.

The A's also objected about this.

Again, I'm just repeating something I heard.  But possibly the cause

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for
argument's sake, define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below
expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I
tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but
I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are
any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can
look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  

Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was rushed, although
there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was
given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what
you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the
next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at
age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,
and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was
performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being rushed;
Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have
been less likely to give up on him.

Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts
performing up to expectations?

Just to add to this vein, consider that range of a first baseman is not
the only important thing.  He is IMO the best fielder of bad throws from
the other infielders.  I have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt, catch
balls off a large bounce, take down balls over his head, wide, etc. ad
infinitum.  *And* he gets the out, much of the time.  Some of the things
he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing.  You have to give
Mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot
near the bag (yes, I am sure he gets a few calls because he is Mattingly :-)

Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,
nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:

a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several
1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip
I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800
miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  
would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.
No problems with winds and curves. 

Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where
we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.

b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see
no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip
back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind
you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better
than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still
get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.

Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough
bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise 
rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well
expect the sucker to last 300k miles.

Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not
pleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos
and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.

As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap! I personally wouldn't
buy a diesel car for any reason - what does it buy me?

Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's, slalom times, they are 67.9, right
along with the Integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
are all -weather XGTV4, not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than
a Beretta.
Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine
Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track.
Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1
You can't tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will
definately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car & Driver and Road & track
have the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.

***You always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a GS-R, and see
for your self, while the GS-R has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000
rpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)

Quad 4 reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable,
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.The Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down. You can rev that car all day, everyday,
and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak
from expierence!)
I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a
better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And
does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.

NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta
is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable
price not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one
source, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While I
haven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines,
(so they are similair.)

	What's the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount?  Both have hung
around for years, and continue to post great stats.  Why shouldn't Dave Kingman
get into the Hall?  Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others?  What the hell do
you have to do?  Ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that Winfield should

Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.
Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.
My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to
their potential, they won't need much offensive support.
I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.
There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other
pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first
or second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most 
runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low 
scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many 
low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,
I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.
They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their
opponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that
you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.
All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers
like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.

Hi Javier, (how are things at Corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?)
Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least,
by warped rotors. When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure
on the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem
as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec).
There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop
should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.

My ex-husband & I used to own Borgwards.  Haven't seen any for a long
time.  They were really good cars.  Does ayone out there know anything
about them now?  I heard they were being made in Mexico, but of course
they wouldn't be the original German - if that's even true.  When I've

Here in Houston last year a woman heard the sound of someone in her
garage, so she went to investigate with a gun in her hand.  She
found a guy in the process of stealing her bicycle.  She quite
reasonably asked him to stop.  He refused, began taunting her, and
as the woman was quoted in the police report, He told me to go
ahead and shoot him, so I did.  The moron survived, and no
charges were filed against the woman.

My father is a huge Tiger fan, and I am a loyal Blue Jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85.  

I don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out.

First of all, Morris in his heyday (81-88) vs Clemens (86-present).

How many Cy Youngs does Morris have?

How many Cy youngs does Clemens have?

Ballparks and such... Fenway average pitchers park.  Detroit, hugh hitters
paradise.   

Morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the Doug Drabek mold.  
If Morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in Minn in 91, Morris
snaps the ball, and throw for Ks.  Otherwise, he just tries to get people out.

As for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believe
that Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to
when he doesn't pitch.  How bad would the Red sox have been last year
without him?  Can you say 92 Phillies?

I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi
great tenacity.  Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen,
but Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.

Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In
my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90
or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs
outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in
junkyards.

I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the
Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least
standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.

Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as
far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than
the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred
to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things
you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more
professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars
running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.

You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal

autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers
foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground
on the identical car in front of you!

>have no respect for their own lives.

If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much
over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much
safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic
because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading
a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.

As you can see, I have two 1987 cars, both worth about $3000 each.
The problem is that maintenance costs on these two cars is
running about $4000 per year and insurance $3000 per year.

What am I doing wrong?

Within the last two months, the follows costs have occured:

Dodge 600 SE (Dodge's attempt at the American German car!)

$1,000 - replace head gasket
$300   - new radiator

Chevy Nova CL (Chevy's attempt at a Japan import!)

$500 - tune-up,oil change,valve gasket,middle exhaust pipe, misc.

Note also that the Chevy Nova CL (1987) has only 70 horsepwer!
Does anyone out there have a Chevy Nova with enough power
to get up even a small hill without knocking? Is there
something wrong with my car, I even use 93 octane gas!
(I have consider going to 110 octane if I can find it!)

Anyway, what are the best maintenance items to do-it-yourself,
and what equipment is needed?

If a manual transmission is a must have, then the M-B 300TE is not in
the running.  You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North
America.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the
distributors) are not interested in manual trannies.

The '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp.
I have an '87 300E, with a mere 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that
it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is always
nice, but I can't complain.

I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions:

1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.
2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel
   drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously hook into
   the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful
   front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it
   does not have this problem.)
3) Huge interior and cargo space.
4) The most rubbery shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It
   was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.
   I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.
   From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed
   the car for an automatic.
5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does
   not exhibit these characteristics.)

You should also check out the new BMW 525 touring.  This is a wagon version
of the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.

IMHO this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all 
of baseball.  My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot 
pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least 
appear in the on-deck circle.  Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot 
excede three runs.

I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in 
determining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the 
ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in 
the next half inning and earn the win.  Has this pitcher earned a win, no 
way.

I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his 
teammates rally to tie the score.  Assume he came in to start the fourth 
and left after the eighth.  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in 
the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win.  The 
third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat 
satisfaction.

Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed
replacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston
soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then
of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.  If the
alternative was replacement level, then I think it would've been very
close, and yes, Morris might've made the difference.  If the alternative

Viola.

Yes.  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented 
the team from collapsing in August.

Well, I think is complete bs.  What happened most of the time is that
Morris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly,
this is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better
the rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes
consistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the
team's credit.

Furthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would
be projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done
this in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot
worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed.
Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.

Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical
Morris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's not
responsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team
just didn't rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did
during much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn't
earn him a victory.

Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start
anymore; he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.

Me too, though unfortunately the Official Line is the one that you
have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence. The examiner's
guidelines are laid down by the government, and the basic rider education
courses have no choice but to follow them. It surprises me that none of the
rider groups here, either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that
the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time
in order to pass, that the front brake must be applied before the rear, that
you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just
when it is justified) - there's probably a few more too, which I can't
think of for the moment. If the riding test could be rejigged a bit 
to include more of the real-world survival skills and less of the 
woefully simplistic crap that it contains now, then the accident figures
would (imho) reduce still further.

Don't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though...

Seems to me that the driver was driving the vehicle visually impaired.
Isn't that like not scraping ice and snow off your windshield and such?

Say, that's another thing that bugs me.  Why don't people scrape their
damn windows?  I've seen people driving cars with *barely* the driver's
half of the windshield cleared.  Nothing else cleared.  This seems
pretty stupid and isn't there something (probably varies state to state)
that says a certain percentage of the glass must be clear?  Oh, well.

Yesterday, a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle
dealer. It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myself
have never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience
of that visit and of an observation of SQUILDLY behavior by other 
customers and/or sales personel:

BACKGROUND:

I ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into cruiser type bikes. My
friend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He
wanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer
that sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. 

The place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few 
Intruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.

Well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I 
moseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.
I could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40),
but I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured
to each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs
firmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the hormone gang
talking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big
deal.

Here is the part that concerned me. The HG and those shop personel that were
not busy with customers went back out, where said HG members fired up their
rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,
one decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.

SQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager
not only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they
were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely
as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her
pilot to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers
could be heard as well as felt.

I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those
in cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and
damning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little
uncomfortable and we left. 

I will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my
anger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open
mind and doesn't associate me with them. 

BTW, I can't afford a new bike.....

This is a piece of psychology its essential for any long term biker to

Methinks you recall wrong. Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and 
continued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left
off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where
even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
at going back down. 

he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of it
on the demotion. I'd much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on
the Cards.

As far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their
uniforms every year.  Every other year (e.g., New York), it will say Mets
in cursive, New York in cursive, or New York in all caps.  Minor changes,
but they do change them often.  Last year, I think they had New York in all
caps.  Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year?  What about
Pittsburgh?

I hate the gray.  They should opt for more color (like the White Sox).
I hate white team versus gray team.  Spring training uniforms look much
better.

Nah, let's reserve rec.sports.idiots for people who POST
obvious flamebait, like yourself.

If someone posts something as controversial (not to mention
idiotic) as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup,
someone should challenge the statement.  There is a school
of thought that suggests that silence = consent.  Whereas
this idea may not apply to everything in life, it certainly
SHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion, which r.s.b.
is.

If you've been reading r.s.b. lately, you'll find
that even elementary school children have had access
to our postings, alibet in an edited form.  It's making me
think a little more carefully about some of the things I post.

In conclusion, if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel
in some obscure newsgroup that I don't read, fine.  He's got the
right to rant, rave, and drool all he wants to in the name
of free speech.  But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read,
then I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal
to his drooling.

Now, of course, you don't have to read any of this.
And if you want to cut down on flames, then




DON'T POST FLAMEBAIT!
(You don't have to respond to flames, either.  Saves cyberspace)

 I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic
to this approach. It's the bikers against the world and the dogs are just 
another worthless adversary. So remember to wear at least calf height leather
boots, ( in case the dog gets lucky and sinks his teeth into your
attacking foot) and go for the gusto, If that dog doesn't retreat from the
street with his tail between his legs next time you see it then you really
haven't done your bit for all your fellow bikers.

seem like a fair fight.

Maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are
responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom. 
These allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times, losing
money, bankruptcies at an alarming rate, and there's going to be an
increased degradation of the product they produce.  Could you imagine
IBM, with all their problems, promoting themselves the way Major League
Baseball does?  Their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths (not
that they are too far from it now :-).  What would happen at GM?  Where
would GM be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an
inferior product because of alleged labor problems? I think it shows a
lack of confidence for the people who run the game.

Forget it.  Word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about
a done deal.  It has to be decided soon since negotiations with the
networks also have to begin soon.

Not necessarily. Maybe some  sort of servo lock or something along those

 >Loud pipes are a biligerent exercise in ego projection,

No arguements following, just the facts.

I was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my
*stock* Harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention.

I instinctively revved my engine before I went for my horn. Don't know
why, but I did it and it worked. Thats rather important.

I am not saying the louder the pipes the better. My Harley is loud
and it gets me noticed on the road for that reason. I personally do
not feel it is to loud. If you do, well thats to bad; welcome to 
America - Home of the Free, Land of the Atlanta Braves.

If you really want a fine tuned machine like our federal government
to get involved and pass Db restrictions; it should be generous
enough so that a move like revving your engine will get you noticed.
Sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle. Should we
get into how many feet a bike going 55mph goes in .30 seconds; or
how long it would take me to push my horn button??

And aren't you the guy that doesn't even have a bike???

Summary: My air vents don't work on my 71 Skylark
Distribution: usa

Lines: 31

I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it.  I bought it in California, and if
it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these
Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.

The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is
stuck in the vent mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air
flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't 
live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the 
defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,
kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.

I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think
the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down
and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-
side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is
probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.

Two questions:

	1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than
	the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?

	2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there
	a way to fix this?

THanks for any advice/info

Mine is strong enough to not let the car move when it's in, even if you're

I remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried
in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work.  I don't remember
why they said that it did not work.  Anyone remember this?

Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was
inevitable.  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first?

Another pair of suggestions:
1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay safe
   no matter what the pitcher does.

2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)
   without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base
   as if walked.

The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows
the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base.

Just to clear things up (as to why I posted the question that way)...
I was debating with a co-worker about diesels.  I claimed they were
cleaner-burning than gas engines.  He said the extra junk put out by them
was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses.   I made all the SAME claims
you did.  But, one question of his was what about the carbon?  I said it
was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it.  I suggested
scrubbers.  (I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install
than cats.)  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber?  (I'd like
to know just to answer his final question.)  I convinced him that diesels
are cleaner otherwise.

BTW, (I named my subject Dirty Diesels because I knew it would get a reaction
out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd
read it...)

  Not with a hub cap but one of those Lumber yard delivery
trucks made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road
and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of
spackle came off at 70 mph. It got real interesting for about
20 seconds or so. Had to use a wood mallet to get all the dried
spackle off Me, the Helmet and the bike when I got home. Thanks 
to the bob tail Kenworth between me and the lumber truck I had
a Path to drive through he made with his tires (and threw up
the corresponding monsoon from those tires as he ran over
what ever cans of spackle didn't burst in impact). A car in
front of me in the right lane hit her brakes, did a 360 and
nailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 360.

The messiest time was in San Diego in 69' was on my way
back to the apartment in ocean beach on my Sportster and
had just picked up a shake, burger n fries from jack in
the box and stuffed em in my foul weather jacket when the
milk shake opened up on Nimitz blvd at 50 mph, nothing
like the smell of vanilla milk shake cooking on the
engine as it runs down your groin and legs and 15 people
waiting in back of you to make the same left turn you are.

Newbie. Sorry to disappoint you, but as far as the Internet goes I was
in Baghdad while you were still in your dads bag.

Most of the people who made this group interesting 3 or 4 years ago
are no longer around and I only have time to make a random sweep
once a week or so. Hence I missed most of this thread. 

Based on your previous postings, apparently devoid of humour, sarcasm,
wit, or the apparent capacity to walk and chew gum at the same time, I
assumed you were serious. Mea culpa.

Still, it's nice to see that BNR are doing so well that they can afford
to overpay some contractors to sit and read news all day.

the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions..  i get much
stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup.. which i can induce
by briefly lifting off,  then quickly (but not too quickly to trigger
a kickdown) applying throttle.  above 3000 rpms, the convertor will never
unlock;  it would kickdown first.

who says there's no skill involved in driving an automatic?  i think
of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal.  with
my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my
right foot, while having both hands to steer.

I need help getting my ZX-11 (C3) to behave.  I've managed to get
the front suspension to be very happy, but the rear sucks.  I can't
do anything with it to make it feel ok.  The bike is very stable
through the corners (I think because I have the front just right),
but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous.  It feels
like it actually amplifies the bumps.  And the damping doesn't seem
to do anything in real-life, although you can tell the difference
when the bike isn't moving.  I've tried 4-5 cm of sag (from
completeley unloaded), but I don't know which way to go.  Has anyone
gotten the rear of this bike comfortable?  And if so, what kind of
settings (esp. what sag) did you use.  I like to corner, but I also
would like my kidneys to remain intact.  This thing makes the new
ZX-7 feel comfy....

Doesn't sound like they attended, though, does it?  In fact, if we riders
need friends, it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from 
Lynn's description, especially if the same crowd gets invited back
to party some more year after year.

You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these lesser
indiscretions.  If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the
indiscretions and the partyers aren't either, maybe the indiscretions
don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless 
good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults.  The only thing that 
really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans 
in the street, but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they 
helped set up the party in the first place.  If I lived there and the
bikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation
and good intentions, I'd certainly rather they stick around and party
than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed.

If it doesn't hurt anyone, and all the parties to the party benefit
and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless, then who 
needs to permit or justify it?  You?  Why do *you* need to do that?

Ironically, these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that
don't happen to fit the stereotype you describe.  They've developed a
friendly long-term mutually-beneficial relationship with a group of 
motorcyclists, and aren't as burdened with MC-ignorance as is the general
population because of it.

However, if you agree some terms, and then, when about to sign, the

is fraud.  There is no 3 day limit on restitution for fraud.

You may have to sue (and win) to get out of this.  You will almost
certainly have to threaten to sue.

Well, it's closer to Bryce than Bryce is to Arches. I'd spend a lot
of time studying the maps, there's a lot of you can't get there from
here in that area. You might want to hit the Grand Canyon on the way
up from California, loop around to Canyonlands/Moab/Arches, and then

Make sure you ride US 12 between Capitol Reef and Bryce, it's been on a

you can also get a state map from them just for asking.

Well, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who hasn't 
matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old 
who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and 
have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim 
Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies 
hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has 
gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. 
I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.

>2.  Who is playing short and third?

Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but 
was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is 
split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry 
Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 
years.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be 
happy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they 
might give too much time to Pags.

Because I'm a guy and most of my pillions are female. 

Also, the other reasons, like having an idea where you passengers
weight is, it being a more comfortable position for the passenger,
and it being a more stable configuration all come into it as well.

Holding the grab rail is a great idea only for braking, when you

I prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be.  I believe that automatics
should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise
would not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy.
More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery
instead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drive
always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving should
be FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.
	In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster
that any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.  For
normal driving go with the manual.

Archive-name: rec-autos/part4

[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly
asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions
of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate
crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]

[last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,
    new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]

                Commonly Asked Questions

Radar Questions:

Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit
    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in
    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,
    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They
    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.
    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other
    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.

Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?

A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,
    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe
    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.
    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently
    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate
    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.
    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected
    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a
    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned
    on.

Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?

A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance
    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target
    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR
    system.

Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be
    able to handle it? 

A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US
    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a
    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the
    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the
    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.
    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low
    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar
    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,
    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such
    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use
    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:
    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they
    are used (or else, don't speed.)

Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?

A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.
    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.
    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the
    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the
    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.

Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:

Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?

A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a
    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)
    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to
    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they
    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',
    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)
    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that
    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into
    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle
    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance
    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing
    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle
    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or
    spinning.

    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car
    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the
    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling
    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to
    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle
    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater
    slip angle than the front wheels.

Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?

A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear
   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally
   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop
   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle
   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to
   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.

Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?

A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while
   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot
   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you
   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to
   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;
   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side
   on the throttle.

   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the
   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing
   the same thing.

Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?

A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of
   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for
   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the
   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with
   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch
   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission
   speed up.

   The procedure is as follows:
   (0) declutch
   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral
   (2) engage clutch
   (3) match revs
   (4) declutch
   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear
   (6) engage clutch

   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.
   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the
   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or
   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.
   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at
   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good
   condition.

Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and
   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?

A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and
   2) almost never.

   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times
   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the
   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine
   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite
   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from
   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*
   major) part of the equation.

   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really
   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically
   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the
   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.
   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads
   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply
   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.

   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the
   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced
   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the
   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making
   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end
   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car
   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'
   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of
   caveats could go on for page after page.

Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according
   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate
   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?

A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.

   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics
   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,
   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a
   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating
   temperature.

   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser
   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a
   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been
   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match
   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire
   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses
   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling
   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire
   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will
   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its
   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some
   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like
   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.
   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal
   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of
   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)

   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,
   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters
   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than
   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible
   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of
   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques
   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.

Misc. Questions:

Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?

A:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked
    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names
    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER
    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.

    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,
              or The Swedish Airplane Corporation

    Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,
              or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company

    Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,
              or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin

    BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,
              or Bavarian Motor Works

    MG:     Morris Garage


Q:  Does VW own Porsche?

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and
    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,
    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some
    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may
    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this
    is only speculation at this time.

Hi, I was looking for some helpful advice.
I'm a university student with about $7000 to spend, and I'm looking for a 
used car. Does anyone have any useful advice they could offer to a first-
time buyer? I'm not looking for anything sporty, just something functional 
and reliable (less maintenance costs). Anybody have any ideas on what models 
might suit me?

Thanks

A-hem. Two words: Russell Davis. Playing in the cavern at Albany (AA) last
year (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), Davis went .285/.355/.483
with 22 homers. There aren't any small parks on the road in the Eastern
League, either. He's 23(!) and his MLE was .258/.308/.416, 17 HR. I have no
fielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd say
that he's not Brooks Robinson, but neither is he Howard Johnson. Unless they
think they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and need
Boggs to do it, I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davis
that Boston made with Boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or three
years after he'd shown that he was a good hitter.

Hrm? They still have him on the roster (16 AB through the first two weeks).
They've just never figured out what to do with him. I suspect that he hits
enough (especially vs. lefties) to be a reasonable shortstop. One rumor
running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert
Silvestri to be a catcher(!) because his body type was wrong for a
shortstop.  You'd think that somebody in the same *division*, who plays
Baltimore about a dozen times a year, would know better.

Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me. I'd guess that this is on the same
chassis as the Kadett, rather than the bigger Manta - but I could easily
be wrong.  I think the later Kadett's were sold here as Buick Opels.

I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler economy tire, the ME77. Good
for mid-size older bikes. Rated to 130mph. Wearing well and handles
my 12 mile ride(twisties) to work well on the SR500. Costs a bit 
more than the Chengs/IRC's etc, but still less than the Sport
Metzlers for the newer bikes. Cost from Chaparral is about $60 for the
front, and $70 for the rear.

Well, the Opel deal fell through...

Now i'm looking at a Datsun 240Z for sale in our local buy&sell.  Any
previous owners have any experience with these cars?  Besides looking
for rust,good compression,low miles, and all the other usual car
things one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that
I should watch out for?

How about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc.  These cars
look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing
resemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagato(sp?), which has to be one
of the most beatiful cars ever made.

What is the difference between 240Z, 260Z, 280Z?  The 280ZX is rather 
unappealing IMHO, but the other cars are decent.

I thought Bill James' latest book completely and totally sucked.  I bought

To all the Braves doubters:

Don't worry.  The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around.
The pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries
to the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well.  Heck, with
the five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an
injury to one of the five (I hope this doesn't happen, though).

The bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice
is catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there's too
much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer.  Right now, the
Cleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300!  But I certainly
wouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the
Braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting
over .300?).

The bullpen... well, it IS suspect.  But when the bats come alive, the
guys in the bullpen will be of less concern.

So anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season.  I'm
not saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but I'm optim-
istic about their season (though it's awful painful to watch them at
times right now).

Go Braves!!!

Dean.

Labour prices for car service are very expensive in Toronto compared to other

any response from Darryl.  I did call him a name.  I referred to him 
as a primadonna.  Someone else concluded that I did that because I
hate him.  I don't hate him.  I think he's a primadonna.  If you
disagree, fine.  But stop putting words in my mouth.

	Yeah, you're right.  Doing away with speed limits would just
mean huge tax increases as municipalities tried to make up for the
revenue they used to gouge from passing motorists.

Enter 1st, wait 2-3 seconds and then go into reverse.  They use the same

What do you mean by all models, all models of cars, all Chrysler models,
all models that the fleet manager had bought? Because there is no way in
hell that the Shadow is the most reliable car of all models sold, not
even Chrysler's dept. of lies, damned lies and statistics would claim that.

    It is certainly possible, and quite easy in most cases, especially
on two-strokes.  It's very common to do this on bikes where the
cylinder-mounting through-studs don't prevent the cylinder from being
removed with the engine in the frame.
    I did this when I assembled the top end on my Indian, which was
easier yet because it does not have through-studs.  Base flange studs,
and separate head bolts, dontchaknow.
    You have to use a little foresight, rags, duct tape, etc. to keep
clips from falling in, clothespins, hoseclamps, etc. to support the
cylinder while you're inserting the pins.
    (Are these called Gudgeon Pins in the UK? If so, what's a Gudgeon?)

	It is available through some dealerships, who in turn have to back

	I have a 6' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she
doesn't get out much anymore, so I don't use the lock that often anymore).  It
is made of 3/4 articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.
It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,
professionals can open it rather easily:

	1) Freeze a link.

	2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).

	3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are
		frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.

	For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is
anywhere from 1/2 to 7/8 thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded
in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type
locking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's
more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat
in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8 model).

	All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel.
Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.

	FYI, I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.

Later,

Currently, he's all over.  He played 2nd when Deshields was out.  He was
shifted to third when Delino came back.  And today, he played SS for a cold
Wil Cordero.  

His natural positions seem to be in the middle infield, but they will seemingly
find a spot for himm somewhere as long as his bat is hot.

Why?  Do you expect him to remain the best shortstop in the game until
he reaches his seventy-third birthday, or something?  Why is it such a
strange concept that a forty-one-year-old Ozzie Smith might be a defensive
liability in 1996?

As of today's USA Today (4/23) John Wetteland should come off of the DL
tonight and possibly pitch in the series this weekend (I forget who they play.)

Derek Lilliquist is probably going to be the main closer, but it will be kind
of a bullpen by committee also.

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and
the car in front, but enough to manuver around it.  Keep the bike in
1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for
engaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.

When the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side
of the car in front of you.  You don't need to panic and do it, or you
will pop the clutch and stall the engine.  Do is smoothly, just
rapidly.  The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection
than anything else (particularly empty road).

Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim
=============================================

Background:

    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving
a 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been
interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing
the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a
remarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.
As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still
have another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.

    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was
already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as
having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.
However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I
can get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the
car received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum
plugs and valve adjustment.

    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.
The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,
although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small
scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the
highway.

    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit
concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To
my surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems
just as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)
Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of
the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and
in front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit
more difficult, but other than that, I love the size.

    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up
for a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the
ride later in this review.


Engine:
    
    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very
interested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha Shogun engine.  I was not
disappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is
good.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although
I don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly
-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good
since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.
(More on this later.)

    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be
unremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit
higher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can
literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve
more valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and
you are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.
The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!

    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the
tach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,
you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than
adequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves
are used.


Transmission:

    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they
marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter
into the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and
remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the
car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.

    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a
Ford recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the
one on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit
larger and more forgiving.

    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter
felt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect
it to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's
much the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's
a clumsy shifter.

    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress
friends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for
the 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this
pretty amazing in a car like this.

    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest
shifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my
Toyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.
Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line
because of the incredibly clumsy shifter.

    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more
reasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works
smoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter
upgrade would help at all.

    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears
smoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to
match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took
several days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems
were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad
shifts in higher gears.)

    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter
refuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to 
get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple
of months.

    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500
rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the
engine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can
definitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,
as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a SHO
sound and is the gearbox -- apparently called gear rollover.
Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.


Exterior:

    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this
SHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are
virtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes
don't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did
differently to the SHO bodies.

    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching
color body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the
SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at
stoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.
:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely
monochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with
SHO stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have
colored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.

    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel
almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and
distinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)


Interior:

    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the
car.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are
covered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in
a black/grey/metallic scheme.  

    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo
and 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a
large compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest
that contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin
holders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding
cassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small
glove compartment.

    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted
to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a
sink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and
thoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the
interior was upgraded!

    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so
much space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)

    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From
what I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.
Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has
cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the
way.

    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal
hand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that
you press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to
it, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.


Ride:

    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than
any car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter
and is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with
less ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a
noisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels
wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I
listened for that before I bought the car.

    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from
Chicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone
from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively
quiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what
exactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window
that rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.

    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the
suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way
too rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would
advise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with
the shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason
to complain.  Let me explain...

    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the
wheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer
making the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I
avoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.

    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.

    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.
My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the
wheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when
driving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so
useful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road
to the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better
than the steering on my Celica ST.

    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?


Miscellaneous notes:

    GRIPES:

    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles
        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.

    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as
	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.
	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)

    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension
	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.

    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the
	side bolsters would close more tightly.  

    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I
	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500
	for four.

    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it
	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't
	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!
	Pretty ridiculous, though.

    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,
	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque
	down low.

    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It
	took me a couple of days before I could really shift
	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)

    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that
	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. 
	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make
	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled Drive It Forever
	for tips in this department.  :-)

    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once
	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch
	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off
	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car 
	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began 
	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of 
	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed 
	the glowing brake light.  Oops.)

    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same
    	thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the
	other windows work smoothly.


    LIKES:

    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The
    	cupholders are great.

    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but
	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by
	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And
	you can never lock yourself out of the car.

    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't
	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years 
	ahead of schedule.  :-)

    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to
	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I
	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines
	and ended up with this.  

    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have
	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this 
	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this
	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you
	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)

    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums
	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice
	the horsepower.  



Other Odds and Ends:

    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.
Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I
haven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still
appear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always
quick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some
of the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)

    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as
well as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be 
posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  

    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!
I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but 
maybe someone out there does.

I stopped going to A's games some years ago while I still lived inthe
Bay Area for exactly this reason.  I believe the length of their games
has been institutionalized by LaRussa/Duncan.  They encourage their
pitchers to be overly deliberate, to throw to first often, to study
the catchers' signals, and so on.  And almost every A's hitter takes
a step out of the box after every pitch.  This is not, imo, a coincidence.
This is planned.  And I hate it.

As for the Gant situation, I did not see the game or the replays.  But
I do wonder.  What if Gant had requested a time out?  Would Hirschbeck
have been required to give it to him?  Could he have denied the requst?
For all he (the ump) knew, Gant could have had dirt in his eye.

Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented 
about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old 
'93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since 
the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a 
service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you 
may be able to get your dealer to fix it.

Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the
mailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.

Definitely!

No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious 
places where they screwed up.

Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by
your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the credit card key that 
came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key
doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))

The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up
all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.

Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one
of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.
The previous Probes had Japanese horns.

I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The

sound.

Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it,
but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly
suggest looking into the MX-6.

The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of 
head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints,
so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to 
give them a place to put their feet.

The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-)
I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker
for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!

>I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.

I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes
('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which
Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like
this concerning the '93 Probes.

I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot
that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even
gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my
car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering
that I was expecting the worst from them!

From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with 
the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but 
I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's
almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.

Hope this helps,

With the popularity of minivans, the market room for station wagons is 
squeezed out. They are not as comfortable as sedan, and don't carry as 
much as the minivans. 

This is not to say nobody wants the wagon anymore. But the demand is certainly
hampered by the minivan, and may not be economical to build a product for.

I've only ever seen this called once.  Back around 1979-1980.  I think
that Steve Carlton was pitching.  On the other hand, I am not sure how
much effect this would have.  It seems that most of the time lost is
when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this.


I have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the
game.  Let's be serious.  The relief pitcher has normally been
throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes.  Does he really need 8
more pitches?

Black ones look better.  None are truely indiginous to America,
although some of the finest are produced here.  Gear is expensive, and
you never seem have enough of it.  Volvos hit them.  Only idiots
intentionally rear up the front half off the ground just to look cool.
Posers don't ride them in the rain.  They are dangerous on ice.  Loud
ones are annoying, and too much chrome looks dumb.

Yep, sounds familiar!

(not that logic has anything to do with it, but...)
I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving,
or something, but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car
in a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable. Furthermore, they
would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation, which is an
additional factor in attributing blame.

Anyway, stickers on the window are less effective... no one has any problem
taking a blade to a window to remove a stubborn sticker, but it's a different
story with that that nice paint job on the door....

  Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant
on the team. (To a large extent). If Frank Thomas hit first, he'd lose a LOT
of RBI's; and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive
in 100 runs? Doesn't happen that often.....very unlikely with Devon White's
~.300 OBP in front of you...

I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by others
to be interesting.  Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these
were completed before the first pitch. :-)

AL East
1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division
2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.
3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect
4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop
5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing
6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak
7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th

Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top
          4 gets pitching should win it.
1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success
2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?
3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.
4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close
5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here
6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs
7.  California Angels - will win no games

NL East
1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!
2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga
3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected
4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a team
5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me
6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing
7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing

NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.
1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern
2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all
3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2
4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993
5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants
6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink
7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.


NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting
                            what I said in my NL West comment.)
ALCS  New York d. Minnesota

World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be
                                     fashionable again

NL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff
NL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo
AL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it
AL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))

That's very true.  I live in Richmond, home of the AAA Richmond
Braves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HR's at home
last year.  Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, BUT the way the
Diamond is built, Home runs are a rarity.   In fact, Ron Gant,
Brian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit in
Richmond.  When they were sent to the majors, they never came back.
If you can hit in Richmond, you can hit anywhere.  

So far, after beating Scranton (Phillies) 9-0 in the first game, the
best team in AAA history has been rather underwhelming.  Too many
expectations I guess.

I happen to be a big fan of Jayson Stark.  He is a baseball writer for the

He writes about unusual situations that occured during the week.  Unusual

That stands for Last guy to get a hit.  He also writes for Baseball

I have been for a fairly hard run in an MX5, what they lack in power they
surely make up for in handling.  Great for back streets with heaps of corners.
They are a fairly light car with a low center of gravity and a quite free
revving DOHC engine, a fun car.  Have you driven a TURBO converted
MX5?  Now they are starting to perform!  I've often thought a Mazda rotary
would go well in the XM5 too....anyone done it?

Regards Scott.

This is a periodic posting intended to answer the Frequently Asked
Question: What is the DoD? It is posted the first of each month, with
an expiration time of over a month. Thus, unless your site's news
software is ill-mannered, this posting should always be available.
This WitDoDFAQ is crossposted to all four rec.motorcycles groups in an
attempt to catch most new users, and followups are directed to
rec.motorcycles.

Last changed 9-Feb-93 to add a message from the KotL, and a bit of
Halon.

			How do I get a DoD number?

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is What is the
DoD?, then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be How do I
get a DoD number? That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List
(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling
creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can
make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-
base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not
that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)

Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll
just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.

By now you're probably asking So who's the KotL already?. Well, as
John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real secret left around
here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,
nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was
the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the
KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely
with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-
oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with weenie
mailers). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a
Dead-Head.

***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************

Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed
work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)
days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of
economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it
just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think
the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).

***********************************************************************

One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what
they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?
The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &
e-mail address. For example:

0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM

(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as
there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)

            Denizens of Doom, by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)

      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]

There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal 
things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  
motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  
helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve
seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, 
traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double 
entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They 
argue with each other and plan rides together.

The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, 
although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each 
other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world 
and communicate with each other electronically via computer.

The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  
the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry 
professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, 
rec.motorcycles (pronounced wreck-dot-motorcycles, it's the file name for 
the group's primary on-line meeting place) carries about 2250 articles per 
month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent 
posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred 
to as the DoD.

The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of 
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer 
enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, Denizen 
of Doom.  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of 
the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of 
course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.

The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules 
appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the 
List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been 
almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and 
Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Norway and Finland.

Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run 
of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the 
American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- 
selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a 
few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were 
donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 
to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs 
in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.

As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go 
riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's 
Silicon Valley.  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on 
Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California 
Joust.

The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big 
barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern 
California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, 
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan 
for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction 
with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.

Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective 
communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional 
motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to 
get together.  Long may they flame.


Live to Flame -- Flame to Live	[centerbar]

This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do 
anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as flames;  
issuing them is called flaming.  Flames often start when a member 
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A 
typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be 
something like:  What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad 
poseur!  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding 
ability and your cat.

          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_

                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011

Periodically the question What is DoD? is raised. This is one of
those questions in the same class as Why is the sky blue?, If there
is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world? and Why do
women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
dump you?, the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,
and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the
halls of academe for generations. 

A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on
a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two
machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but
who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and
signed it The Denizen of Doom. Not wishing to identify himself, he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. 

He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was
the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty
easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership
number. 

Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized
electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a
gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members. 

In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet
feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized
and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list
(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating
around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by
#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and
distributed on VHS by #18)! 

Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,
placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine
management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?
Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. 

The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only
ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which
includes name, state, and email address. 

The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name).

                      The DoD

              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1
 
Welcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of
all time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? The
Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent
(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of
your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against
you. Read 'em and weep. 

We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible
Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to
Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: 

Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! 

Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW
     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer
     11 but what the heck.  

Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.

Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at
     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!
     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a
     Woosh-a-stream.

Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.

Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???

Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see
     what they say, eh? 

Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.

High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.

Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!

Terrible: B.T.???

Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.

Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.

Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? 

Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.

Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.

Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.

Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!

Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???

Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean 
     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! 

Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.

Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with
Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and
the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! 

Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?

Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?

Heritick: Nahhh.

Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.

Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?

Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!

Muck: What's a carbujector?

Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!

Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!

Dill: Well, where do we race?

Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't
     ride! 

Muck: No! No! Quiet!

Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.
     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!

High: My 9 too!

Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!

Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!

Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more
cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the
infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! 

Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like
     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting
     it up on the ole ventral stand!  

Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and
     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! 

Booster: I hate Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.

Booster: I love Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.

Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?

Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.

Muck: What about a Tridump?

Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?

Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?

Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?

Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.

Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.
Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.

Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.

And Now even more west coasters pour in.
Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!

Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!

Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:
Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.

Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.

More riders from the west coast come into the discussion:
Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.

Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.

With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It
was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. 
Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. 

Muck: Why??

Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.

Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.

Clean: No GOOD!

Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!

Clean: Inferior!

Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys
burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a
thrill... 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? 

Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,
     WILHEM! 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? 

And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the
thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all
boomed out.
G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding
     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. 

All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.

Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding
mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the
next gut wretching episode of The Yearning and Riderless with its
ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will
be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the
question of: To Helmet or Not to Helmet will be aired, this is heady
material and viewer discretion is advised.

          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video

                by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94


[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call
Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,
with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] 

(editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens
referring to each other as Chuck. I guess you had to be there. I
wasn't.) 

Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,
 cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,
 may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted
 to live a man's life,
[Music slowly builds in background]
 riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes
 and the deepest valleys,
 living the life of a Motorcyclist;
 doing donuts and evading the police;
 terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;
 eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,

	I Want to be      A Denizen!

[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with
fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of
an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels
sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,
showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil
on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat
Boy.] 

Chuck [Sings to the tune of The Lumberjack Song]:

I'm a Denizen and I'm okay,
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:
He's a Denizen and he's okay,
He flames all night and he rides all day.

I ride my bike;
I eat my lunch;
I go to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays I ride Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus]:
He rides his bike;
He eats his lunch;
He goes to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays he rides Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus refrain]:
'Cause He's a Denizen...

I ride real fast,
My name is Chuck,
It somehow seems to fit.
I over-rate the worst bad f*ck,
But like a real good sh*t.

Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!

                    Why you have to be killed.

Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed
to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started
as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.

Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: What does DoD
stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it? Naturally, a
Denizen who had watched the movie Top Gun a few times too many rose
to the occasion and replied:

That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.

And the rest is history.

A variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about
what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where
known) include:

Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts
Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters
Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death
Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes

Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.

                     The rec.moto.photo archive

First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck
Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,
and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in
unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not
only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.

Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk
at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the
server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,
the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.

Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how
to use the archive.

**********************************************************

Via ftp:

cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]

Via e-mail:

The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the
message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The
arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For
rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:

dir [dod]
send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif
send [dod]dodframe.ps

and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts
of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.

Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to
the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of
50K each; not a good idea.

A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so
why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?
Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours (California time).

                      Patches? What patches?

You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &
pins. And your reaction was probably: I want!, or That's sick!, or
perhaps That's sick! I want!

Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that
there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad
news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't
because of any exclusivity attempt, but simply because there is no
DoD store that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by
individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is
someone says I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost
$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one? Then
orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a
DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all
this is anarchy in action.

Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and
perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),
motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts
(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and
patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by
popular demand].

All profits have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association
Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,
you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of Denizens
of Doom, USENET, The World, complete with a DoD pin.

~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum
~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT

I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,
the other day.

Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:

Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the
Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is
now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude
to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently
being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to 
see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,
I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank 
you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the
museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

                                Sincerely,


                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395
                                Director

P.S.  Please post on your computer bulletin board.

As you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally,
it was meant for all of you who purchased DoD goodies that made this
amount possible.

                        Organized (?) Rides:

Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third
year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got
together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north
as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of
North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great
Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]

Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the
Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,
riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal
2-strokes.  And though it's not an official (as if anything could be
official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races
in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.
European Denizens have staged some gathers too.  (Your ad here,
reasonable rates!)

Yeah, hypothermia is MUCH more detrimemtal to your judgement and reactions
than people realise. I wish I had the patience to stop when I should. One
day I'll pay for it....

If you  begin to shiver - STOP and warm up thoroughly. If you leave it
till the shivering stops, this doesnt mean you're OK again, it means 
you're a danger to yourself and everyone else on the road - your brain
and body are working about as fast as a tree grows. You will not realise
this yourself till you hit something. The next stage is passing out. 
This usually means falling off.

My fiancee' and I do quite a bit of sporty riding 2-up.  I'll tell you 
what we've found and the systems we've worked out.

- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the rider
to judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something
and leaning forward.  Remember this.

- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally 
this means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned
over and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.
Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous.

- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough 
for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding 
onto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fast
because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which 
shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.

- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not 
out wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.

- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.
Normally this means slow down, and do it now!.  


> turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional
> signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???

We only have a couple signals.  Slow down is her either tapping me on 
the back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency
of the matter :-)

Turn here is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is
also the sign for cool!  Look at that.  I hafta pee is the same sign
as turn here.  I'm hungry is the same sign.  Go faster is usually
done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see slow
down more often than go faster.
 
> I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that
> she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...

The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and 
pillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're 
in almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because
you as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely
feel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes
at any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  
Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.

Also, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up
than by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and
in the Zen of the moment less.  Remember this.

The answer is - they're stupid.  Seriously, I think you're right
on the money; I've never understood the preoccupation with making
sure a rotation has left-handed starters.  The only time it makes
sense to me is when you have an unbalanced schedule and your main
rival(s) is loaded with lefthanded hitters.  Other than that, I think
you're completely right.

Does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a BMW after changing
the oil yourself?

Also, I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five
yellow service indicators went out. That means I don't need oil service until
it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. Any idea?

Well, you can just about set your watch by Honda releasing new models every
4 years and an upgrade half way through the cars life. The local acura
dealership tells me that the new Integra will be out very soon, i.e. May/June.

Its hard to find specific details as the Integra has been deleted from
most of the rest of the world - I have seen them in Canada and Australia
as well as the U.S. but it was discontinued after the first generation
in Europe. Normally you can see new Japanese models appear in Europe
or Japan first and extrapolate from there. C+D reported that the engine
would be a carryover I think.

All you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident,
get a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact
the other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they
would in an accident they caused.  Thus no need to go to court.  A friend of

Last week I posted the ALL-TIME GREATEST PLAYERS (and haphazardly misspelled
several names--SORRY!)  This week, it's time for the greatest PEAK players.
I evaluated the following players on 4 consectutive seasons which constituted
their prime or peak years.  (3 was too few; 5 seemed to many--so I settled
for 4).  Sources, as usual, include Total Baseball 1993 and my own (biased)
opinions.

I hope there are some surprises here: Raines above Muisial?  Carter above
 Bench?  Ripken above Banks?  Bonds above Mays?
Check the numbers of each player in comparison to the numbers of the rest
of the players that year(s), and you'll see that I'm fairly close with
this ranking system (which is primarily based on Total Player Rating) for
four consecutive years.

Enjoy,

to take this to its, er, logical conclusion, it is impossible to

or a better pitcher than juan guzman, or a better center fielder than
devon white.  after all, if i were on the blue jays, can you really

OK, something to shoot for.  The Royals will score 531 runs or less
this season (although they just decided to get McRae out of the
leadoff spot :-( )

Of course, Valentine will throw this one back in my face when the
Royals even manage to outscore another AL team.

The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the
right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and
went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he
missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,
reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.

Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially
behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and
just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch.

Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is
impossible.

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first
nine games.

I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull
hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan.

No need to appologise, as a matter of fact
this reminds me to bring up something I
have found consistant with dogs-

Most of the time, they do NOT like having
me and my bike anywhere near them, and will
chase as if to bite and kill. 

An instructor once said it was because the 
sound from a bike was painfull to their 
ears. As silly as this seams, no other options

They bein' themfolk who tend to compose fair piece of the population;
bein the ones that regard bikers as a loud, irresponsible, irreverent,
reprobate rabble.  
Sure you didn't rape and pillage-- It's a relief to know that you were
such gentlemen-- but because you were not completely out-of-hand you 
justify your lesser indescretions?  Some pretty distorted thinking, I
should say.  
Oh-- I'm sorry, I just noticed that you left mucho bucks (as in MONEY)...
Nevermind my criticism, I was out of line.  I forgot that when one leaves
mucho bucks (as in MONEY) their behavior is permissable, perhaps even 
justified.

Keep in mind that themfolks are the ones that could give a %$#@! when 
a biker gets killed, when *their* elected officials institute further
draconian legislation (helmet laws, gun controls, etc.), the ones that don't 
respect our rights on the roads because we do not respect theirs all the
rest of the time...
Need I continue?

So continue to wear your stigma as a badge, but the next time you are
whining about them and the effect of their values on yours, remember
that it was probably the behavior of self-righteous wusses like myself
that kept them at bay for this long.

Enjoy,

When I say black, I mean US-born black people for the purposes of this
discussion.  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947, and one 
team in the 50's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did.  

>And why would more hispanics stick around than blacks?

Don't know.  But remember: this is the country that had special racial
laws for one group and one group only: blacks.  Our national history 
includes huge, long-term, global tensions regarding the black minority; 
the hispanic minority, while often discriminated against, has never been
the object of national obsession.

Absolutely.  As I said before, I expect that this effect is disappearing.
But it certainly did exist, and all out talk of TWG's and all that is 
not without some small reason.

Unfortunately, I've got another story to add to this.  My girlfriend
and I were driving through west L.A., and got pelted by a rock just as
we were pulling away from a stoplight.  The scary thing was that the
rock was heavy enough to put a decent-sized dent in the door of my '72
Riviera which is pretty much solid Detriot Iron.  Couple of inches
higher and it would have gone through the window.

Hi. I have been thinking about buying a Motorcycle or a while now and I have
some questions:

-Is there a buying guide for new/used motorcycles (that lists reliability, how
to go about the buying process, what to look for, etc...)?
-Is there a pricing guide for new/used motorcycles (Blue Book)?

Also
-Are there any books/articles on riding cross country, motorcycle camping, etc?
-Is there an idiots' guide to motorcycles?

ANY related information is helpful. Please respond directly to me.

Thanks a lot.

There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights.
It will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs
the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try
di it yourself. 
You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset.
Why is reseting so important? The only reason for doing
it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you. 
Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every
15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and
extending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't wait
for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car. 
I bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changed
the oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil,
air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils
and done almost all of the other things req for service 1
and a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights.
After a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad.

Good luck!

One of the reasons I sold my '92 Civic VX was the chattery-grabby clutch
although I din't notice it being any worse in humid weather, perhaps because
its always humid around here.  I was told by Honda that it has to do with
changing from asbestos to non-asbestos linings, which began around 1990.
Someone could make some good money selling the old-fashion variety if it's
legal to manufacture them these days.  My feeling is that since many other
car makers do not have this problem, that it's a poor design or engineering
problem on the part of Honda.  Three things to look out for on all Honda
products - clutch chatter, bad brake rotors, and rusty exhaust systems.

I've seen it as Colmn also.

Blame the Associated Press.  After the official scorer balances the
official score card, they copy it and give it to several diffent people. 
One of those is a person from AP whose job it is to type it up (using a
template on a laptop) and transmit it to the AP offices in New York
(Rockefeller Center) via the telephone.  The box scores are not checked
and just rebroadcasted over AP's news delivery services.  If there are
corrections, those are issued later.  It is the person sitting in front
of a laptop at Shea (or whereever) whose fault that is.  [NOTE: The AP
puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in
most newspapers being the first one]

Last week they were in Denver.  Maybe the AP person in Denver did this
(remember, they just started with MLB out there).  Check tomorrow's
paper (4/21) and see if the person who is doing it from Shea does the
same thing.

I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent 
experience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in London. 

I found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot, that
is, if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on
hard for braking or acceleration. I tried to always look over the
inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible, leaving
Dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and 
luggage.

Hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit 
off the back is hard to fight. Similarly, I held on to the grab handles
tightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (I'm
a lot bigger than he is...). Reaching around him and pushing off the 
tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for 
him to manage.

On the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself, I absolutely
refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. That's
helmet, jacket, gloves, stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. It's 
not my responsibility to provide this gear, but it's my responsibility
to require it if they want to ride.

And I agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experience
carrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried
many passengers before, take a few gentler rides of some duration before
you head off to a difficult road like Mines/Mt. Hamilton. That's a 
nasty place to find yourself in trouble.

: Hi there,
: 
: I'm german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now.
: There are many problems occuring for me. One of them is the ERA statistic for
: pitchers. What does it say ??

ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per
nine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned
run, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA
is 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided
by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.

	ERA = (ER/IP) * 9

An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed
to a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented
the third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.
Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base
when the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:

	If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If
	an error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after
	this error and NOT counted as earned runs.

	If a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game
	before the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who
	were left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,
	and the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are
	attributed to the pitcher who left the game.

I hope this explains things for you.

Hi.

I'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name)
was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable.
They are.  There's a space between each link where the teeth of the 
locking head notch in.  Thus, each link is a possible locking point.

Also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around
liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks LOOK a lot
more effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial
appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at-
cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally 
functional.

Finally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, and
the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the rain
dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give
me a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially
inflammatory action at stoplights.

I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur.
(I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e., on my
body) and I can feel the bike already shaking away).

Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated 
pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over 
New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started 
with a solid single to right, moved to second on Bob Kelly's infield sneaker
down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a 
rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.

Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only 
given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double
by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after
Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who 
argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by drawing the line (really, he
should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting
tossed.

The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must 
have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's
single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell
and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson
failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:

Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield
to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:
Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.
(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)

The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's
ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back
singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long
fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but
third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was
hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.

Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner
on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game
in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on
Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended
up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a 
week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went
to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings
work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit
surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.

The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory
today.  The Mets are 6-5.

I have the same problem with my '90 probe.  The water is definitely not comming
up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare.  I have to remove the
rubber stopper to drain the water.  Seems like a common problem with probe.

Yo! Watch the attributions--I didn't say that!

Again, this isn't an appropriate forum for discussions on whether you
should shoot someone for property damage/vandalism/theft, but every
responsible gun owner realizes that there are limits, and the punishment
must fit the crime. I mean, think about it--is a (really) harmless
prank worth killing over?

As I said, the situation described (punks setting off alarms and
taunting people to come out) could turn very ugly very quickly, and
it is worth being prepared when your life is potentially on the line.

Perhaps so. I was only responding to the Yankees of the 20's and 30's 
part of the comment. If those teams were a 'sure thing' and lost, 
then it's probably not so unreasonable for someone to pick another 
team (not that I did).

I don't know why you guys keep bickering about Morris. The stats show he
is a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened
to win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good
games. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was 
constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings)
and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor in
his 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would
leave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win
games (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).

Has anyone any experience with the (new?) Yamaha Cyclelok ?

It looks like it uses the same hardened steel as a Kryptonite U lock,
but unlike a U lock, it is hinged in 5 places and opens out to a large
rectangle (longer length than any U lock I have seen, plus it folds down
to real small), so you could lock the rear tire to a steel post for example.

I was curious as to how well the jointed sections would stand up to attack ?

There's a blurb in the STATS Scoreboard about this, and though I don't have

I haven't been following the previous HR's.  But there are two, that I saw
live that would have to be up there (up where? there!).  
1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981.
It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter.
Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee
warming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP,
Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that
time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into 
Montreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing.
Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almost
came back though...
2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, so
far.
and
3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left
the stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!

Summary: Why the repeated leaks?
Keywords: clutch master cyl problems

I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions.
The '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles.  ABout
a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        
leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid
back into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and
got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem
licked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months
later!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure
there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I
didn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch
hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I
would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the
problem.

I should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the
pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in
order to actuate the clutch.

My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,
the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the
cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.

What do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix
short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?

Now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain
why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the
passenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which
the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What
can you suggest here?

Many thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...

After reading the service manual for my bike (Suzuki GS500E--1990) I have
a couple of questions I hope you can answer:

When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill
cap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?  I am more used to
the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean
and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike
is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do
I remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without
screwing it down before reading?

The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on
the head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do
you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?

My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter
replacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?

As always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia
has finally turned WARM.  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes, and the riders
ALL waved.  A nice change of tone from what Philadelphia can be like. . . .

Moreover, if two riders are riding together at the same speed,

Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls.
On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you,
you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when
you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when
you were surprised by an oncoming car.  That crash was
due to factors that were subject to your control.

I won't deny that there's a combination of luck and skill
involved for each of us, but it seems that you're blaming
bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted.

metal between the winshield and right front window.  My girlfriend was
in the seat next to it.  I called the police from the next exit, but I
doubt if they were found.

About five years ago in San Diego someone was put into a coma from a
brick being thrown through his sunroof as he was driving and
subsequently crashed.  I don't think he ever came out of the coma, and I
haven't heard anything about it for a couple years.

Probably because there are many children there.  Also the minor fact
that other than defending themselves from 100 some people attacking them
they haven't threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in
years.  Being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds
for a mass murder of Koresh and his followers.

Sorry for posting this to this group, but I thought the previous post
needed a rebuttal.  If you follow-up to this portion please cross-post
and direct follow-ups to a more appropriate newsgroup.

Would anyone out there in DoDland be able to help me out in giving me
a contact to purchase a pair of military air-borne combat boots (9 1/2
D in size).  These boots (so I have read here on rec.moto) are calf
height boots that use only velcro for enclosure.  I have phoned around
and nobody seems to carry such an item.  I admit I have not gone into
the deepest bowels of NYC yet for the search but I have made some
calls to several of the bigger army/navy type stores with no luck.

Anyone out there know of a place that does carry such an item as well
as does mail order?  Any help would be appreciated.

Because riding a passenger doesn't really depend on the type of bike.
The things you want a passenger to do/not do is the same.  Ergo, if he's
asking advice, I reasoned he doesn't have much practice, period.  If
you say he does, fine.  I still wouldn't take the uninitiated up a
road that's all switch backs and reverse/center/uncrowned roadway, not
to mention the BDCs and squids who will also be on that particular
road.  He asked for advice, and even though it wasn't what he meant,
I still consider it some of the best I've read.

Back in my youth (ahem) the wiffy and moi purchased a gadget which heated up
water from a 12V source.  It was for car use but we thought we'd try it on my
RD350B.  It worked OK apart from one slight problem: we had to keep the revs 
above 7000.  Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement.

It made for interesting cups of coffee, anyhow.  We would plot routes that
contained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to
get the water to boiling point.  This is sometimes difficult in England.

Good luck on your quest.

	I just went through this mess in New Jersey (I'm still waiting for a
refund as well), namely, that the original company made a mistake and left me
in the lurch.  My recourse was through NJ's insurance dept. Office of Consumer
Protection.  You should have a similar office in your state.  Make use of it.

He believed one of two things: 1) Sabo was more likely than Samuel
to get a hit OR 2) that more good would be done in the long run
by leaving Sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome.

In fact you don't know what Perez had in mind when he left Sabo in.

>By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite.

In fact, I don't think anyone is claiming that they can predict
the future, or any particular future event.  But we can believe
that certain trends are due to a cause (whether or not we have
identified the cause) and therefore will continue.

I think seeing insults in other people's opinions is kind of silly.
After all, Mark didn't call you a total idiot, or call your work
stupid, he simply stated that it didn't change his opinion on the

If player A hits better on Tuesdays and always has, and Mark believes
that it might be an indication that he will hit on Tuesday better next
season as well, would you respond the same way?  At some point you
might admit that all variable might not be known to you (who knows
what this guy does every Monday night?  Maybe he sees his sports
shrink on Tuesday mornings, or has his Vitamin B shots Monday nights?)

But this is something that's true of one guy only.  It doesn't
mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire
league by days of the week, nor that there should be.  But it doesn't
mean we can't make predictions based on that for that particular
player.

That's exactly what Mark is trying to do though.  Find hitters

Huh?  What does gambler's fallacy have to do with anything?
Whether you can know the reason for correlation or not, you can't
deny that it has existent, you can only make an argument that
you don't think it is likely to continue to exist because you
can't see a reason for it to exist.

Someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate.
The argument along the lines of star player with L/R splits will
always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game
(i.e. opposing manager will always bring in a AH pitcher to
face him, where his manager will not pull him for a PH)

Hi there,

      I was wondering if anyone knew if John Wetteland was put on the DL again
      after his first 15-day period was up? I read in the USA Today Sports 
      section that he is on for surgery to repair broken toe, and was
      wondering if that was new. I thought he was just letting it heal. 

      Another question, Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now
      that Olin is gone. I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to 
      replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok. Any information on
      either of the players would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your
      time.

Both protests would be denied, of course.  The umpire's judgement
determines the garbage thing, although I think the game should be
called (but that's my personal opinion...doesn't matter).  There
is time only when the ump says, so the second argument is baseless.

Here is a story.  I bought a car about two weeks ago.  I finally can
get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence
history of the car.  In between '91 and '92, the instrument pannel 
of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset
to zero.  Therefore, the true meter reading is the reading before
replacement plus current mileage.  That shows 35000 mile difference
comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from.  The 
dealer never told me anything about that important story.

I hope that I can return the car with full refund.  Do u think this
is possible?  Does anyone have similar experiences?  Any comments
will be appreciated.  Thanks.

Summary: Earl Weaver Commandments

	The Orioles' pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season.
Four shutouts, low team ERA, (Well, I haven't gotten any baseball news since
March 14 but anyways) Could they contend, yes. Could they win it all?  Maybe.

But for all those fans of teams with bad spring records, remember Earl
Weaver's first law of baseball (From his book on managing)

No one gives a damn in July if you lost a game in March. :)

BTW, anyone have any idea on the contenders for the O's fifth starter?
It's pretty much set that Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald and Rhodes are the
first four in the rotation.

Here at Johns Hopkins University where the mascot is the Blue Jay :(,
their baseball team logo was the Toronto club's logo. Now it's a 
anatomically correct blue jay. God, can't they think of an original idea?
It's even in the same pose as the baltimore oriole on the O's hats.
How many people realize that the bird is really called a baltimore oriole?

This is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division.
But the Giants are going to need every break they can get, if they
want too hold that lead.  I don't think they can afford to be
lackadaisical, and say well it has worked pretty well so far, and
while we might be able to improve the results, we don't think it is
worth the risk.

re: extended Ka bands.

I recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I'm
nuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this
area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state
as well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:

- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know 
  what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I
  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,
  Ka stands for K automatic... duuhh.  He then went on to say that
  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high
  tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.

- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,
  even the real sneaky ones.

- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here
  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used
  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.

So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting
months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high
performance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal
to their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that
Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully
relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at
least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.

Because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near
making up for the large difference in hitting.  Their average
seasons, using their combined average 656 (AB + BB) per 162 games:

         Years  AB  H  R  2B 3B HR RBI TB  BB  AVG  OBP  SLG  OPS
Santo    14.10 577 160 81 26  5 24  94 268 79 .277 .366 .464 .830
Robinson 17.55 607 162 70 27  4 15  77 243 49 .267 .325 .401 .726

Fielding, we have, per 162 games at third,

         Years   P    A   DP   E   PCT
Santo    13.15  149  348  30  24  .954
Robinson 17.72  152  350  35  15  .971

Even if Robinson's extra 3 putouts, 2 assists, and 5 DPs are taken to mean
he was responsible for 10 more outs in the field, that doesn't make up
for the extra 28 outs he made at the plate, not to mention the fewer
total bases.  The difference of .104 in OPS should be decreased by about
.025 to account for Wrigley, but a .079 difference is still considerable.
The Thorn & Palmer ratings are

           Adjusted      Adjusted    Stolen   Fielding  Total
           Production  Batting Runs Base Runs   Runs    Rating
Santo         123          284        -14       137      41.7
Robinson      105           52         -5       151      19.8 (26.3)
Usual disclaimers about T&P's FR apply, but they really shouldn't be
way off the mark in this comparison.  At least it's better than fielding
percentage: Carney Lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 FR,
dead last of all time.  Also, since this total rating compares players
to league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be
awarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  He had a great
career, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.

But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.
That's a similar story, Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's
superior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better
choices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports
this point of view.)

Not totally true.  For the past year or two, the AP has been getting box
scores from STATS, Inc.  The AP representative in the press box is actually
a STATS reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking.  And anybody can
do it.)  The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago, some quick error 
checking is done, and then STATS sends it to the AP.  I'm not sure where
the appreveiations come in hear.  I don't think it is at STATS's.  It may
just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day. 

While I'm mentioning STATS reporters, they are always looking for new
people.  Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh, you're road
to getting into the press box may be real short.  For more info, call 
STATS (708) 676-3322, and ask about the reporter network.  It's a fun
way to get paid for watching baseball games.

On a related note (since UPS lost my Chain Wax and I'm still using PJ-1/Goo),
I found some great stuff to clean chain spooge of wheels.  It's called
Goo Gone and cleaned the spooge off my rear wheel faster than the Simple
Green cleaned the bug guts off my headlight.  Wonderful stuff.  I recommend
that we officially delcare it a DoD Wonder Spooge (tm) product.

wrong!  the GS300 and SC300 use straight sixes, while the ES300 uses a
V6.  only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a V6 and inline
6 in its lineup, but that won't last for long.

	Checker Motors went out of business in 1982.  It's hard to get
old Checkers that are worth restoring, since almost every one was
a fleet vehicle that was driven into the ground.  If you can get a 
body in decent shape the mechanicals should all be available _somewhere_ - 
Checker used whatever parts were around.  For instance, I had a Chevy
straight six and a GMC Truck radiator and a Ford rear in mine.

Hi! This is my first time to post on this news group. Now a days , I have stucked at a certain problem. I have '88 mazda mx-6, non  turbo fuel injection.
   There is a engine warning signal on the dash board. While driving, this signal turns on, but not always. What does this mean? In the manual, they say Go to authorized mazda dealer.. It is really good idea. Don't you think so? 
  I wanna know how the engine warning signal comes. Is anybody out there who can give me same advice as authorized mazda dealer can give ?

No argument at all with Murphy.  He scared the hell out of me when he came in
last year.  On the other hand, the club though enough of Boever to put him into
an awful lot of games (he may have led the league in appearances - he did at
least at some point).  He seemed to be a very viable setup guy - but I guess
that's not considered that crucial by the club.  I can just remember two years
ago so well, though...

I'm not that concerned.  Those guys have been relatively consistent over the
years and they have no good reasons to decline (no injuries, not old, ...).
I expect them to come through just fine.  It's those guys that have not
been consistently good that are the worrisome part, even if they are coming
through right now.

This sounds like their old road unis.  Pretty dull.  Buttons or pullovers?
I'll check through my uniform book to see if they've always had some orange.

Well, we'll see.  I've got a Astros pullover shirt with the Astros stripes
across the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in public.  i
can see why they might want that to change.  Gee, if they eliminate the
orange, will they reupholster the seats in the Astros stripes section (what
used to be the gold and yellow levels - I don't know those numbers they use
now).

I saw a pinstripe version of an Astros cap and I actually thought it looked 
good!

Fine, are you willing to bet that he will bat .400 the rest of the way?

The point is that he has hurt the Rockies so far; it's that he *will* hurt
them, eventually.  Just as much as he hurt the Expos and the Cardinals the
past couple seasons.

We'll see come September.  (I have an outstanding bet with someone that

I have just a couple of questions about this technique.

First, what firing order should I use?  Do I start with my pointer
finger or my pinky?  Left hand or right?

And secondly, I have a 12cyl and there are two cylinders unaccounted

   Another pair of suggestions:
   1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay safe
      no matter what the pitcher does.

   2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)
      without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base
      as if walked.

This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases
considerably.  Suppose the pitcher uses up (N-1) of his N pick-off
attempts.  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base,
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it
right this time.

Would this suggestion apply to pick-off attempts per pitch, per
batter, or per base runner (on the same base)?

Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers (one of 
my least favorite) in LA (Sweet!).  Also the Mets (my other least 
favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a 
great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.

Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be
hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots
of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on
situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower
this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and
Lankford and Zeile's off year).

I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the 
Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  
Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games 
and we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching 
staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the
difference.

On a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some 
baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked 
where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied Fair.  I 
remember it being in the They Said It section of Sports Illustrated.
I would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.

GO REDBIRDS!!

OK...

5) How about a fuel gauge that *really* told you how much fuel was
   left.  Like, can I make it to where the gas is $1.14 or should
   I get gouged right here at $1.35?  Accurate to the tenth of a

Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! The basic reason
is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is
No Big Deal. Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV, we can abort 
children on demand, and kill the sick and old at will. So why be surprised
when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. They don't care because the
message they hear is Life is Cheap!

You're right: Thomas, Gonzalez, Sheffield, and Griffey don't even begin
to compare with Ripken, Boggs, and Gwynn, so no wonder Alomar gets so
much attention.

Sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was
terrible.  So was his sophomore year.

National League pitchers are much better pitchers?  That certainly explains
Sheffield's 1993, hm?  Are you confusing have ERA's that are 0.40 lower
because they don't face DH's with much better?

Al Weiss played second for the White Sox in the early sixties, chiefly as
back up to Don Buford. Good glove, no hit, some spunk.

Your list of Jewish ballplayers includes Levi Samuel Meyerle (son of
Jacob and Margaret Meyerle). Although that sounds like a Jewish name,
Meyerle's surviving relatives say he wasn't Jewish, according to
Nineteenth Century Stars, published by SABR in 1989. Incidentally,
Long Levi (he was 6-foot-1) batted .492 in the first season of the
National Association, the first pro league. Needless to say, he hasn't
been topped yet. (Of course, the NA is not considered a major league
by officialdom.) Over five seasons, Meyerle hit .368 in the NA. He also
played for the first three seasons of the NL, hitting .329.

>I eagerly await comment.

The ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the 
driveway when she sees me coming. Probably only hits 25mph, or so. (I made 
the mistake of waving to a neighbor. She has some sort of grudge, now.)

I was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came 
flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with 
my front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard 
me and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from 
my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of 
the road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the 
final trajectory. Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph 
from the other direction.

I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off 
the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front 
tire. It managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. (peripheral 
imminent doom?) I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have 
swerved into my lane. The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back 
home, but I haven't seen it since. 

Sniff.

	Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for
R12.  You don't hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning Society
(MACS), that is, the people who stand to rake in that $300 to $1000 per
retrofit per automobile, have mounted an organized campaign to squash those
R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether (on very shaky
technical grounds, at best, on outright lies at worst).

	Does this piss you off?  Yes?  Write a letter to your congressman, to
your senator, to the president, to the EPA, and to the DOT and complain.

Did anyone happen to see Peter Gammons on ESPN last night?  He addressed
this exact issue, and dismissed it rather quickly.  According to Gammons,
advanced scouts are reporting that Morris' fastball and slider still have
the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability
to keep the ball hidden during his release.  Guzman and Stottlemyre have
gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a
little work with the pitching coach.  Gammons looks to see Morris back in
top form within the month.

I, on the other hand, still have my doubts.  Morris' ERA last year was
rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games.  His showing in the Series was
not surprising.  Although I'm not convinced that he's washed up, I have my
doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the
Twins in '91.

Be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the
mirror.  It will depress the foam liner in the helmet.  That is not the
kind of foam that bounces back, like foam rubber.  Its purpose in life
is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin.
If your mirror compresses it, there is that much less energy absorbing
capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash.

I found the right handlebar to be a good spot, if on the sidestand.
Hang with the chinbar facing up, balanced across the grip and brake
lever such that the weight of the helmet doesn't compress any of the
chinbar foam.  This is more challanging with an open face helmet.

I definitely do.  That's why I don't like going to see games played

Well, your idea of interesting differs from mine.  I think
batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special
effort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the
delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are
interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control
of the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and
should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins
has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.

One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its
open-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going
to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to
go on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed,
and some games are slow and lazy.  That's fine by me.  Those folks who
want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel-
surf and cater to their short attention spans.

>Is it just me, or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield?

He's been playing horrible defense. Baylor said after Wednesday's game that
he wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because Bichette has been
having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting.
He was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young
was in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.
Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for
these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.

In defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium
is a bitch to play. Some of the visiting outfielders have been having
some problems too (although Bobby Bonilla made a great catch crashing into
the wall to rob Daryl Boston of an extra base hit in Thursday's game)

Tom Prince is a 28 year old no-hit catcher.  Think of him as a young Dann
Bilardello.  I can't begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of
losing this guy, who's been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons.  The Pirates
released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options, then
eventually sent Prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep.
He's another year older, and still can't hit; why do they think he wouldn't
clear waivers now?  Why would they care?

I came across this interesting information in my local public library while  
researching minivans.  It is the dealer price and the retail price for a  
minivan I am thinking about purchasing.  Someone told me that the number for  
base price was slightly lower than the current price, but this should still  
give you some idea about pricing and how much you can negotiate.

My Honda Accord just hit the magic 100,000 mile mark and now
all sorts of things are beginning to go bad. The latest problem
I am experiencing is with my brakes.  They still stop the
car fine, but once I am stopped completely, my brake pedal
will sink another 2 or 3 inches all by itself.  If feels really
strange, and I am worried my brakes will quit working one of
these days.

I checked my brake fluid, and the reservoir was full, but the
fluid itself looked really dirty (like dirty oil).  I called
my mechanic and he told me I need a new brake master cylinder,
which will cost me a whopping $250-300.

I was just wondering if anyone out there has experienced this
sort of thing.  If so, is my mechanic being honest? Or do I
simply need to have my brakes bled and new fluid put in?

Any help you could provide would be appreciated.  Please send
replies directly to me, as I rarely have a chance to read this
list.  I will post the responses if there is any interest.

Thanks,

Joni

 THis is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin
theirs.... implying that the Nissan Quest/ Murcury Villager are out-selling
the Chrysler mini-vans.... not only is this not true at all, but it was a stupid
claim to make... the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the 
vans.  Kind of a bold statement to make when you haven't even sold one yet, eh?


And I thought Buick and Oldsmobile where bad.  Shame on you Nissan and

Yeah, really, no shit!

Like that jerk Loch Faircloth that couldn't win an election
as a democrat so he switches to republican the year before this
past election and takes Terry Sanford out with his bitch
and moan campaigning typical of NC senate/house/gubner races.

I swear, I'd kick Jesse Helms in the head if I ever got the chance.

Maybe then he'd get a fucking clue as to how the rest of
the world lives.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my Honda Accord break question.
It does seem that the master cylinder is bad. I will have my
mechanic double check and be sure it isn't something simpler
and cheaper first, but from your responses it sounds like it
is very likely to be the master cylinder.

Thanks everyone!!

I know there's already a bmw mailing list, but since it's an R bike 
only list (and limited to the R80* R100* bikes as well I believe)
I've decided to give this a go and see how much interest there is.
please read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list!

there is only one restriction for the discussion on this list, that it
be about BMW's. I don't care which BMW, any and all are welcome. I will
probably post articles that appear in the local BMW club newsletter, and
would incourage other club members to do the same, especially tech
articles.

to subscribe to the list, send a message to the list address:

                    bmw@rider.cactus.org

with the word SUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message. having
the word SUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to subscribe. if you 
put the keyword in the message body, your message will go out to everyone
on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief.

       ** your From: line must have a valid return address    **
       ** the list sw will use the address in your From: line **

if you would like to use a return address _other_ than what is contained
in your From: line, do not send mail to the list! send a note directly to
me (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll take care of it manually.

the list sw will hack up the outgoing message From: line so that your
original full name in ()'s is preserved, but the return address is
replaced with the mailing list address (bmw@rider.cactus.org). this 
allows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list (depending
on your mail interface natch. I use elm so that's what I wrote it for :-).
keep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors
parentage.

to remove your name from the list, send a message to the list address
with the word UNSUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message.
having the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to remove
your name from the list. if you put the keyword in the message body, 
your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed 
beyond belief.

the list is run from my home system, a poor little 286 box running a
very old version of something that smells somewhat like unix. the MTA
isn't the smartest around, but I've managed to hack it up enough to make
a decent list MTA. additions and removals are handled automatically by
scripts that intercept messages based on the subject (see below) and
may occassionally goof. the sw will send a response message back when you
subscribe. if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount
of time (my link is via UUCP and sometimes runs in spurts), send me a 
message (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll look into it.

if the list turns out to be too popular and the MTA groks over the number
of addresses, I'll have to freeze the list recipients until I can come up
with a better MTA.

good luck...

The Civic does still come in a 4 door model.  My wife and I looked
quite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well as
some other cars.  Our impressions: all three seemed well built and had
the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want
except for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are
considering anti-lock brakes.  I also hate automatic seatbelts and we
both think having an airbag is a plus.  In general, comfort and
performance were both significant.

Some specific +'s and -'s are listed below.

Mazda 626
 + very comfortable and roomy
 + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is
   hard to find
 + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:
   tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat
 - more expensive than many other cars listed below

Honda Civic
 + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here
 + comfortable front seat
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof)

Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla
 - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary)
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 + can get ABS without lots of other extras

Saturn
 + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so
 - motorized attack belts

Dodge Spirit
   no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok
 - rear seat does not fold down

Chevy Corsica
 + comes with ABS standard
 - lower would you buy that car again and safety ratings in
   Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above)
 - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +
   for some)

The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the
626, and in our minds, not significantly better.

We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the big 3,
due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products,
(b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate
of mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the
seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts
and no air bag.

We'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A/C and
cassette advertised for just under $12800 (Washington Post, April 14,
I think), and my local dealer says they can match that price.  I will
probably get the 626 (maybe tomorrow).  The main question in my mind
is whether or not I will have to do a factory order or preference
order to get one with ABS, and whether or not the dealership will
run the price up a lot if I do so.

Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators, and I've never 
seen nor heard of a vandal opening one.  I imagine that there
would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have 
to crawl furthur under the car to open it.  

Car vandals are usually real traditional in their methods, and do things
that don't get them dirty, like keying your car, dumping sand, sugar
or mothballs in the gas tank, TPing it, etc.

Depends on what you mean by for a living.  1974 was the year he led the
league in pinch-hit at bats with 50, but he'd been getting a lot of PH ABs
earlier than that, and was never a full-time player.  20-35 PH ABs early in
his career, 15-20 a year just before going to the Dodgers, and 30-50 in the
peak years.

We're talking about a guy with a 20-year career as an outfielder, a .300+
career batting average, and 1130 or so career hits.

To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a 
contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current 
heights.  You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 again
at any time during this year.  Then you must predict either:

(1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or

(2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.

So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as 13-13 (resend it if you 
were serious, Val!).

ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was
in 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place.

So email me your guess, either at barring@cs.washington.edu or directly
replying to this post.

	The runner can leave his base at any time.  If the ball is caught,
he's got to tag up.  If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at
all.  So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up.  If it isn't caught, he's probably scored
a run.  If it is, he's probably headed for AAA.  

	The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out,
thereby removing the force on the runners on base.  All other rules apply,
as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.

We heard about this from a newspaper article.  Journalists and editors
always pick out the most interesting and sensational facts for our
delectation.  As the editor of the Sun once said: We never let the
facts get in the way of a good story.  You must have noticed how
motorcyclists get treated by the press.  They thrive on hysteria,
ignorance, sensationalism and one-upmanship.  Unfortunately there's
not enough salt to keep taking a pinch of.

Do you mean Juan Berenguer?  He was traded for Mark Davis in the middle
of last season.  Exchanged one stiff for another, as Berenguer hadn't
come back from his injury in 91.  I think he's retired now.

Anyhow, as middle relief, Marvin ain't that bad.  He at least can
pitch a couple of innings or do mop-up work.  I don't know much
about McMichael (was he the Mexican League guy?), but
everybody else in the pen is a 1 inning man, except maybe
Mercker.

Without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war, I would like to
question the notion that sitting a rested player down has any real
effect on his long-term performance.  Sure, if a man is tired and needs
real rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act.  Perhaps if
a man is mentally strained, then sitting him down might help to the
extent that that helps him relax.  But I would like to suggest that
in the long run, players do slump, and benching is probably irrelevant.

I think there is a legal clause in the RR name, regardless of who owns it
it must be a British company/owner - i.e. BA can sell the company but not
the name.

These are the figures from the Performance Bikes lock test, taken without
permission of course. The price is for comparison. All the cable locks
have some sort of armour, the chain locks are padlock and chain. Each
lock was tested for a maximum of ten minutes (600 secs) for each test:

	BJ	Bottle jack
	CD	Cutting disc
	BC	Bolt croppers
	GAS	Gas flame

The table should really be split into immoblisers (for-a-while) and
lock-to-somethings (for-a-short-while) to make comparisons.

Pretty depressing reading. I think a good lock and some common sense about
where and when you park your bike is the only answer. I've spent all my
spare time over the last two weeks landscaping (trashing) the garden of
my (and two friends with bikes) new house to accommodate our three bikes in
relative security (never underestimate how much room a bike requires to
manouver in a walled area :( ). Anyway, since the weekend there are only two
bikes :( and no, he didn't use his Abus closed shackle lock, it was too much
hassle to take with him when visiting his parents. A minimum wait of 8
weeks (if they don't decide to investigate) for the insurance company
to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin.

Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US
but very common in the UK. The UK distributor, given in the above article
is:
	Michael Brandon Ltd,
	15/17 Oliver Crescent,
	Hawick,
	Roxburgh TD9 9BJ.
	Tel. 0450 73333

The UK distributors for the other locks can also given if required.

Don't lose it

Velarde hasn't been to Columbus, if I recall, for about three
years.  Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but
when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat.
He might be demoralized about not playing full time, but
he hasn't been shuttled around.  I think he's been in New York
ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I
believe.  
I don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot
it around either.  I think if Velarde is given a chance,
he could become extremely productive.  I don't have any stats
to back this up, and I don't know if his Defense would
cost any games, but I think he could help - and he has
this year.  He has 3 HR already.  Same goes for
Jim Leyrtiz.  He has a big mouth, but he does get
the job done when he concentrates.  I think the situation
with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential
super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing.  I
think he might have realized something when the Marlins
or Rockies didn't select him.
The Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now.
Kamieniecki and Wickman/Militello in the bullpen?
Ouch.  I'm praying that the BP will return to last year's
form....

On my ride to work in the morning I come to a stop light where there are
3 lanes in my direction.  One for left turns, one for straight through, and
one for right turns.  All clearly marked.  Plus there is a clearly marked 
bicycle lane.  I ride into the right turn lane with my signal on and stop at 
the stop line.  Looking left to see if I can make a right turn on red and
when I start to move discovered that some idiot has pulled into the bike
lane and is trying to pass me on the right.  GRRR.
   I always do a head check on bike lanes.  Not always for bicycles. . .

I Love it how all of these people are blaming the Phillies success 
on a weak division.  Why don't we look at the record of the teams in 
each division (READ: Inter-Divisional Play), we'll see that the East 
is really kicking the shit out of the West.  I know it is early, but 
that is all we have to go on.  Atlanta is just so strong with their 
.188 BA, Cincinnati is 2-7 coming off a sweep at Veteran's Stadium in 
Philadelphia, and Houston was swept in it's first three games by the 
Phillies in the Astrodome.  That, my Western Division friends, shows 
that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you 
think!!

Attendance in 1992 was down. By .3%. From an all-time record in 1991.
In people terms, attendance was down by 310,000 from 1991 to 1992. Two
franchises, the Dodgers and Mets, were down by 1,100,000 from 1991 to 1992.
Had either of them not been entirely awful, MLB would have set another
attendance record in 1992.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	As far as I know, a save opportunity is when it is 7th inning or
beyond, and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game.
	For example If it is the bottom of the 8th inning and Clemens is
pithching. The Red Sox are leading 4-1 and Clemens has just givin up a hit. So,
there is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the game
with a homer.  If Jeff Russel came in, (The Red Sox reliever), and finished the
game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score, he would get the save
and Clemens would get the win.                     
                                                Thats how I beleive it works.

A friend of mine had some sensors damaged by flood waters, Ford denys any

the service engine light flashes generated from this.  Came up with the

I like Alomar.  But I'd like to differ with your opinion about a city
which is likely to pour in the votes....

I attended many games last year during the balloting.  I know that a
great number of the attendees DID NOT fill out their ballots, but left
them, beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands.  Toronto gets
no more and no less votes than any other city for the All Star game.

Unfortunately, this is not a one time thing.  I've attended games
during the last four seasons, and it has happened every time.  The
apathetic attitude to All Star ballots really offends me.

IMO, the Royals don't have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae
suddenly began channeling for John McGraw.  OK, they have some decent
pitchers.  But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind
and McReynolds and McRae and an over-the-hill Brett, you're not going
to finish .500 unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him.

I'd say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck.

	The part about spending $5000-7000 on repairs reminds me
of an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs
of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that.  The result,
which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the
end of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't go
wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.

	Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more
in initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra
on repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car
needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things.
I would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more
in repair costs.

  Well, after suffering from an intense fit of Minnesota-induced cabin fever,
I've decided to road trip to Milwaukee and take in a couple of games this
weekend. A couple games at County stadium will be great to relieve tension, 
but I thought Why not go to Wrigley for a game too?  

  I see the Cubs are playing the Phillies on Sat (2:05 start, I believe
that's Eastern time listed). I figured it would be fun to bounce down to
Wrigley for the day game and live it up a little. I'm wondering if anyone
(esp. Cubbie fans) have some advice on: 

  1) If I'm taking 41 (Skokie Hwy) south until it runs into 94, what's the 
     best way to get to Wrigley? I'm planning on getting there an hour or  
     two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy. 

  2) Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or
     3) on game day? I figure since it's early in the year, Ryno's out and 
     the weather isn't great I should be able to get tickets. If not, what's 
     the best way to get advance tickets; can I call the Cubs' ticket office
     directly and pick up tickets at the will call window?  

  3) Any advice on where to eat before or after the game? 

  4) Do they allow inflatable I-luv-ewe dolls (present from Lundy) into the 
     bleachers? :-)

	Probably the most famous V16 is the one Cadillac made from about 1925  
to 1935.  They had to scale down then because the Great Depression really put  
the crimp on luxury cars.  It had 452 cubic inches with over two hundred horse  
power.  They don't make them like they used to.  
	There were others though.  Packard had one until about 1930 whe it down  
sized to their legendary Twin-Six, their mainstay for the next twenty years.   
Lincoln and Pierce Arrow might have also had one but I am not two sure.
	Most luxury and semi-luxury cars of this era at least experimented with  
V16 if they did not actually produce them.  There was actually a cylinder war  
among the Big Three to see who could produce the biggest engine.

A few months ago, in one the the motorcycle mags, there was
an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to
be available thru BMW.  The idea was that the tape would look
black in sunlight, and reflect in other colors at night to
headlights.  It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime 
visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction.

I talked to the local BMW dealer about this.  I was told that the 
only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being 
used in a coming line of BMW clothing (rainsuits).  He wasn't aware 
of anything regarding self applied tape.

Has anyone come across this from BMW or any other source?

The 1941 Lincoln Continental was the first car to sport the continental

> Can someone recommend how to ship a motorcycle from San Francisco
> to Seattle?  And how much might it cost?

I shipped my K75S from Portland Oregon to Daytona for this years
bike week (I rode it back!).  The company I used is The Federal Co's.
You can reach them at 1-800-747-4100 ex 214.  You either have to be
a AMA member, or maybe it is just a discount for AMA, not sure.
(Call 1-800-AMA-JOIN to become an AMA member)

The shipping cost is based on the number of miles.  It cost me about $500
for Portland to Orlando.  $80 of that was insurance.  All I had to do is
ride it to the shipping dock and siphon the gas out.  I think they can
also pick up the bike from any business.  The bike arrived on-time at
Orlando.  All I had to do was adjust the mirrors and add gas.  The bike
was in perfect shape!

I'm from Dallas, and you have alot of nerve saying that WFAN has a bunch of 
Hoodlum Mets fans.  During the football season, the local cowboy station here 
had the WIP on several times for simultanious broadcasts.  I have never heard  
a bigger bunch of low intellect, bed wetting ,obnoxious, woofing, cranial 
deformed, assholes in my entire life!  The IQ of the average eagles fan must 
be in the 10-15 range at best, and they have been known to be big droolers.

Really!?

Methinks somethings wrong with _your_ bike.

Perhaps you meant _pull_?

Pushing the right side of my handlebars _will_ send me left.

	Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm
	going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's
	got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter -

	It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin 
	was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  
	BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third 
	and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the 
	replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a 
	serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year

and didn't you also say that it was easier to add masses than to

the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles
for the orthodox inline 4, they are using a horizontally opposed 4,
which is unique in that market segment.  and porsche also uses a flat
six in their 911, so what's the problem?  i don't see any claim that
their engine is as good as a porsche's.. they are simply pointing out
that they use the same configuration as a porsche.. if you want to
nitpick ad campaigns, i think there are far more blatant excesses than
this.

Stuff deleted...

I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sport
for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the
freeway.  Several persons were killed when said blocks came through
their windshields.  Many overpass bridges are now fenced, and they
have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges (as if that would stop
such people).  Yet many bridges are NOT fenced.  I always look up at a
bridge while I still have time to take evasive action even though this
*sport* has not reached us here in Fresno.

Dear Gillian

That is such a wickedly cool idea; why didn't I think of it??? However, here
in Canada the aerials (antenna) are usually near the driver or passenger areas
and I would surely be seen......but I'll give it a try anyway.

Thanks for the first truely useable piece of information I have heard in a long
time (and you are by no means a mere female, as this way at getting back takes
real guts to do).

i am 99.99% sure that subaru (and porsche) use the boxer configuration
and not the inline 4 crank that you analyzed and compared. would you
care to re-evaluate the other case of a flat four?  i think that this
configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary, secondary
forces and couples are concerned.  i have an article in front of me
that says so.

the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted
longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal
placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain.

i think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours
are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free,
though some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a
boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of
recent hondas can approach.

Well, Maddux looked excellent as the Braves shutout the Cubs 1 - 0.
Justice drove in the only run with an RBI single in the first. Get
ready for him to have a monster year. He is now hitting the ball to
the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural 
power to right field and his good batting eye. If he stays healthy
which he should (his back is full strength this year) he should
get over 100 RBI and close to 30 HR.

In another note, the Marlins got off to a good start beating the
Dodgers. I believe the score was 6 - 3 but I'm not sure. I wish
them and the Rockies well this year. Hell. I think it would be
funny to watch the Dodgers hit the cellar again this year.

Yes, but

	(a) we were talking about peak level, not career averages
and
	(b) Clemente was the best fielding RF of all time, as far
	    as anyone can tell

I did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak comparable
to or better than Winfield.  In my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement, you
could make good cases for Ruth, Aaron, Ott, Robinson, Clemente, Kaline, 
Maris, Klein, Jackson, Waner, and probably a few others.  This is not a
knock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other
players had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while Winfield has
been more uniformly excellent.  Hall of Fame?  Absolutely.  Top-10 peak?
I'm not so sure.  Top 10 total career value?  Yes, almost certainly.

Foolish me.  And here I thought it had something to do with the 
fact that they were hitting against Wakefield, who had no kncukle
to his ball that day, and Otto, who has no stuff.  I wonder if 
Reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the

A HBP, but it reminds of my favorite (apochryphal ? sp ?) Don Drysdale story.

When ordered to intentionally walk a batter who had hot-dogged on him in
two previous at-bats, Drysdale reared back with the first pitch and
drilled him right in the ribs.

His manager came storming out of the dugout and yelled What did you do that
for ?

Drysdale growled back, What are you complaining for ? I saved you three
pitches !

Incidentally, if this is true, I'd love to know the other people involved.

     Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66?  True,
Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,
these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with
lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas
Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.
     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb
pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a
chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no
pitching.  At least, to me.
     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team
with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real
order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but
with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)
Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,
Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.
     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by
seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in
their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all
the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all
the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.
     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-
time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results
I would love to see that.

I would gladly spend twice the money for insurance, rather than using
Geico.  Not only do they supply radar guns to the police they also want
to make radar detectors illegal.  They also ask if you have a detector
(probably to put you in a high risk group or just refuse to insure you).

I know a few people who were droped by geico due to an accident that

Yes, that's him.  Was I not specific enough?

Just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that
they have a quick bat.  Dawson's release is slow, and he *IS* 38, after
all.  He may swing early, and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to 
the left side all the time, but he swings slowly.

In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap
that is going on in the MOA, (which some folks took not as dissemination

I would post this one, which came to me yesterday.  This is from board member
Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse.  This is NOT my words, O.K. guys?

                                   April 4, 1993

re:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement 

Dear Chick:
      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the 
MOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the
Owners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by
the by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:

Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to
a combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.

    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's
statement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with
the word undertiding [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement
of his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a
grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does
not just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the 
process.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps
you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.
     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would
be most appreciative that when tou call me an asshole you remind the
letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost
guaranteed to have woeful consequences.
   With kind regards, I remain,
                                 Robert Higdon

O.K. MOA'ers, You read it, think for yourself, I trust you do know who
Cecil King is, and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass, and he is
a pres. candidate.  I let you draw your own conclusions.

On the other hand, remember the old adage that a verbal agreement isn't worth
the paper it's printed on.  Once you sign, you are going to have one hell of a

Perhaps a nice used '88 Pontiac Fiero GT?  2.8 liters.

Does anyone know if the motor mounts for the 2.8 and the twin-dual-cam 3.4
liter match?  The 3.4 is supposedly derived from the pushrod 3.1, which was
a punched out 2.8 liter.  Should be a drop-in replacement, eh?  205 horses in
a mid-engine the size of a Fiero?

Folks,

I am assembling info for a Film Criticism class final project.

Essentially I need any/all movies that use motos in any substantial
capacity (IE; Fallen Angles, T2, H-D & the Marlboro Man,
Raising Arizona, etc).  
Any help you fellow r.m'ers could give me would be much `preciated.
(BTW, a summary of bike(s) or plot is helpful but not necessary)

Thanx

No Mr Fisher, you should place the burden of proof on the one who makes the

Despite walks and loses, Ryan deserves to be in the Hall of Fame (IMHO)

First off, Jeff has had like 5 hits in the last two games, and walked
*yet again*.  Sorry Ken, but Jeff King does have some power, which
means his SLG won't be below .300, and his walks are *way* up.  If
that increase is real, Jeff King will be an above average NL third
baseman in 1993.  Jose Lind, on the other hand, *still* doesn't walk,
and clearly isn't a .320 hitter.  My bet is that he won't be getting
any extra bases either once everybody starts pulling the Lind Shift
we were seeing in the NL.

>Any predictions as to when he is sent to Buffalo or released outright?

No, although since the Lavalliere weirdness, nothing would really
surprise me.  Jeff King is currently in the top 10 in the league in
*walks*.  Something is up...

I agree with Jeff's reply.  I've never changed the brake fluid except when
having a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot of
freeway driving).  However, I will start to do this as preventative
maintenance on my new car.  Also, there are brake system flushing agents
that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the
system, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended NOT to use them unless
you are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent.  Just for
your info, I was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for
flushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so I don't
know if it was more without the brake job. This is in the S.F Bay Area.

							April 1, 1993


I am participating in an NL-league that uses standard Rotisserie rules
except that the following catagories are used:

For position players:
	lowest batting average
	strike-outs
	caught-stealing
	errors

For pitchers:
	losses
	blown saves
	higest ERA
	'taters allowed

This is the fifth year that I've participated in this Blowtisserie
league.  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that
I had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average
which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up
for this by helping me lock first place in errors).  Anyway,
someone offered:

Andres Gallaraga for Bud Black

I can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott.
However, I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season.
Should I make the trade or not?

Your comments will be appreciated.

Sorry 'bout that - Mine is a '91 model non-turbo 2.0. (with ABS and revised
suspension (whatever revised means)). I'm in Australia, so we always seem to 
get the versions without extras which the Europeans and Americans get as 
standard.

My query is, - why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about 2-3 months after
an oil change. I just find it a bit wierd that this happens. Is it the oil I'm
using (Mobil 1) or is it the engine (the 3S-GE version/model) ie. gets
noiser the older the oil is (I'm only guessing). 

Its not annoyingly distressing or anything, but just slightly puzzling.


Puzzled.

Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the
fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel
was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage
than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their
350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big
mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine
could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with
these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --
DONT BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.

Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,
LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper
in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?
Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?
No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a
500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.

I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.
Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline
engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that 
when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350
engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about
$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long
and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine
costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection
pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,
you never need a tune-up.

If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.
Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.

Good luck.

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court
a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and
plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity
to listen to some of the creative excuses offered the judge by others.

After listening to a number of Well, I was passing a very slow truck
that suddenly speed up versions, I decided that the judge had heard
just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than
impressed with any of them.

This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a
rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.
He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph
zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had
alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.

The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose
and said in his sternest voice: Well son, those are some pretty
fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for
your self?

Well Sir, meekly the defenant replied, I just was over to my
buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home.
He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and
was doing 110 mph on his way home.

The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the
maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him
to attend remedial drivers training school.

Isn't America Great??

Hello everyone,
   I have an insurance question.

Allstate insurance

SITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person 
reports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost 
exceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is totalled because of 
exceeding repair costs.
Person says WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here! and takes it to 
another place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the 
dealer.
One more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred 
in Pennsyvania.

QUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, 
now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled?

Please respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of 
thing.

Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at
least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.

I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But
Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.
That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded seasoning.

In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind

Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know
what it means.  :)

But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball
is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.

I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from
your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I
think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly
more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It
may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.
Seems like pretty good common sense to me.

So, that is the reason why the Toronto Blue Jays *should* keep Alfredo
Griffin, just because it worked?

A team winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is right.
A team not winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is wrong, or
otherwise (to borrow the Sharks' situation) you would say that George Kingston
should be fired.

By then, it's too late.  The problem with not fixing something while it's
working is that by then, there may not be anything left to fix.

So, the Blue Jays were simply perfect last year; there was nothing that they

It was also the worst engine that Ford (Europe) have ever made - bloody
awful reputation. It's most successful application being the Transit
van.

Saab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph 1854 (half a Stag V8) under license (I believe), but with 2-litre capacity and perhaps a different
arrangement for the cylinder head studs, before developing their own straight 
four from the Triumph.

Well, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but
really, he only retired 26 batters in a row.  The first out of the game
was the front end of a double play.  Still counts as a back-end perfect
game in my book, though. 

Congrats to Chris Bosio.  Too bad the Brewers couldn't hold on to him.

	Yes, there are still alot of MGBs out there.  The earlier cars (pre
 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having 
chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are 
appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the 
moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.
If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car 
should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. 
 The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes 
that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting 
the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.

I have a few questions about the TAX on  a used car purchase.
I live in New York State, and I am going to buy a used car.
I know that I will have to pay tax when I go to register the car.
But I would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, or
on the purchase price.  Also, what tax rate is used ?  The owner lives in
Albany (8% tax), and I will be living in Saratoga with 7% tax.  
Do I pay Albany tax or Saratoga tax ?  (the difference is a whole $50)
One more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ?

Did I leave anything out ? What else might I have to know to purchase and
register a used car ?  (I've never done this before.)

Right.  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM
gets more runs?  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but 
doesn't score them all himself, who cares?

Consider:

Player A: single.
Player B: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd.
Player C: Double, B to 3rd.
Player D: Sac fly.

B gets a run, D gets an RBI.  Are you *sure* they helped the team
more than A and C?  Think hard, now.

I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where
the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear
taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced
the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time
I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The
dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to
fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same
problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5
years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try
to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent
and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is
getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)

I think there is another formula for ERA.  I heard something about it last 
year.  Im not sure what it is, but im gonna give it a stab.  It allows for
a pitcher to pitch more than 9 innings at a time and not benefit, cuz it
uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched...

        ERA = (ER*27)/outs recorded

Like i said, im not sure this is exactly it, but im pretty sure they changed
it to something of the sort.

I believe we are down to two:  the 15-day and the 60-day.  (I don't remember 
a 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length 
is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long 
as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be 
periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you 
cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not 
wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day 
that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I 
believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When 
there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between 
the lists.

He was picked up by the Jays, but had to be offered back to the Braves

	No, no no. The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much
like the pod people from planet Mars, who can take on any form (the
ability remains the same, however). The Ack-people have been spotted on
many teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentioned
above) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner and
Rojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughed
up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his
system rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact
the authorities! This evil plot must be stopped! (the Ack-people can
keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman, though. I enjoy watching Toronto fans
suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal ;-)

Hi netters,

My friend is seriously thinking of getting the Subaru SVX. There is
a local dealer here in Seattle selling them for $22600, with
Touring package, that's $7400 off from MSRP. He thinks it's a 
very good deal (and I think so too). Since he knows I have access to
the net, he would like to get anyone's opinion about this car, especially
in the area of reliability and maintenanability.
Please send e-mail to me as my friend doesn't have access to the net.

My opinion about this car is, you get a lot for $22600:
auto everything (tranny, climate control, windows, locks, folddow rear seet),
full wheel drive, 2+2, fast (143 top spped), heavy (3580lb);-)

Thanks in advacne!

The Royals are darkness.  They are the void of our time.
When they play, shame descends upon the land like a cold front

Other than that, I guess they're OK.

As I won't be able to make the Joust this summer (Job related time 
conflict :'^{   ), I plan instead on going to the Rider Rally in 
Knoxville.

I'll be leaving from Chicago. and generally plan on going down along
the Indiana/Illinois border into Kentucky and then Tennessee.  I would 
be very interested in hearing suggestions of roads/routes/areas that 
you would consider must ride while on the way to Knoxville.

I can leave as early as 5/22 and need to arrive in Knoxville by 6PM
on 5/25.  That leaves me a pretty good stretch of time to explore on 
the way.

By the way if anyone else is going, and would like to partner for the 
ride down, let me know.  I'll be heading east afterward to visit family, 
but sure don't mind company on the ride down to the Rally.  Depending on 
weather et al. my plan is motelling/tenting thru the trip.

From the Rally I'll be heading up the Blue Ridge Parkway, then jogging
into West Va (I-77) to run up 219 -> Marlington, 28 -> Petersburg, 
55E -> I-81/I-66E.  After this point the route is presently undetermined
into Pennsylvania, New York?, and back to Chicago (by 6/6).  Suggestions 
for these areas would be of great interest also.

Many thanks for your ideas,

Enjoy,

You're obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted
individuals, because barnacles don't each send $20 to the crew of the
ship to keep it moving.

Get the organization to act on it is easy to say, but says little
about what one really can and should do.  What the organization
actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors,
as far as I can see.  That's what makes it so important to vote in an
election of officers.

It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active (in
the state and national arenas, not infighting) than other M/C
organizations.  Should we change this?  Or just join the other groups
that already are in politics?

(Incidentally, the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at
the moment don't compare to the problems of some other groups like gun
owners.  Just try to take up target pistol shooting in the Northeast
or California, and I bet you'll wish you only had to worry about
wearing a helmet.  (Why does every thread on rec.moto eventually come
around to guns?))

I'll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted.

For most career K's with one team, if it's not Ryan, perhaps Steve Carlton.
With the Rangers, Hough was there for a long time.

In the 100 saves department...Maybe Lee Smith(he should have at least
a hundred with the Cubbies, maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards.)
Then maybe, Gossage?(NYY and SD), Fingers (MIL, OAK)

Don't know about the homers/steals dept.

In some other article,(Mets trivia), it could be Tim Leary in at least
the losing to all teams, maybe beating all of 'em too.  Probably Seaver
and Koosman fit too.

And in Randy Johnson's no-hitter, I think it was Scott Bradley, the
other half of the old Mariner catching platoon, who was behind the plate
that night.

think again!!  thanks to 60 minutes (tick tick tick), used 200
quattros are bargains.. '89s go for about $15K, '90s go for perhaps 1
or 2K more, the 20 valve 91's are quite a bit more because of an
enormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about $23 to $25K if
you can find one.  i have seen quite a lot of '89-'90 200 quattros (not
that many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very high
quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will never
rust.

in short, typically a 4 yr old 200 looks no more older than a 1 year
old and the 5 bangers are bullet proof engines.  200K out of one is
not rare, even for a turbo, which is watercooled for the 200s.  then
there are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost...

if you are into luxo-gizmos.. the cars are loaded with just about
everything too..

the price of parts is a different story though...

in a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small
car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small
cars listed.  There were many such cases of 'great' vehicles
where you wouldn't survive an accident.  Is it only me, or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?

In this morning's paper (or was it on the radio?), Vizquel was quoted as
saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still
easily thrown out Riles, that he barehanded it instead so as to make the
final play more memorable.  Seems a litle cocky to me, but he made it

I had thought that Williams batted after Mitchell.  Wouldn't that show that

The point is moot, though, becase Clark pretty much demands to be 3rd
and, like you point out, Bonds does like to bat 5th.  The only person
left to bat 4th is Williams.

Because it wouldn't be a Jeep if it didn't. A friend of mine just bought one
and it has more warning stickers than those little 4-wheelers (I guess that's
becuase it's a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it's written in about ten places that
the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made
it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit
that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the 
highway as for bikers. They may participate in this discussion, but they're
probably few and far between, so I maintain that this topic is of interest
primarily to bikers.

Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the 
two parts of the statement. Besides, around here it is quite rare to see 
bikers wear goggles on the street. It's either full face with shield, or 
open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of 
bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound 
sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.

Ok, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the
point. I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean
my shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered
mess) and I'd see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight
t-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really
specific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that 
splattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?
Image? Laziness? To make a point about freedom of bug splattering?

There is a great book out called They Also Served which is about the 
ballplayers during WWII.  There is some info on Berg in there.  It also has 
info on Pete Gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era.  Because
of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the
draft for medical reasons.  There are some very interesting stories in the
book. It is very well written and I would suggest reading it to anyone with an 
interest in baseball.

Me, too... RBI are a worthless stat. Of course, so is stolen bases because 
sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. And of
course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases,
so batting average, slugging and obp out, too.  Hmmm... i guess homers would
not count then, either.
My point? RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. And no stat (or lack
of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. Maybe no stat CAN tell me,

Automotive Mailing Lists (Electronic Mail, that is):

[last updated 3/17/93; new lotus, exotic cars list subscription info;
   added Portland, OR motorsports list, Corvair list, Triumph TR8 list -- rpw]

There are a number of electronic mailing lists on the network devoted to
various special automotive topics.

To the best of my knowledge, all the lists appearing here have open
membership policies.  It is my policy not to list `closed' mailing lists
here.

Most mailing lists provide separate addresses for administrative
queries and for general mail; where separate administrative
addresses exist, I have listed those below, as the general addresses
are not appropriate for inquirys and requests.

While on my bike I wave to anyone who looks.  Sort of like the small town
or wide open spaces type thing that someone from Louisiana mentioned. (Like
when I'm in Arkansas or Helena MT.)  Kids are especially fun - both genders
(Watch it Cliff!! :-) )  

In the cage I usually wave to bikers.  They usually don't wave back.  My wife
thinks it's strange but I don't care.

i have no experience with State Farm, but i think it's important to
differentiate your experience from a typical accident.

hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner, and also tends to
be well publicized in the media, so it's to the ins. co.'s benefit
to respond promptly and helpfully.  damage like this doesn't imply
anything about the likelihood of future claims (unless you live in an
area that gets frequent damaging hail storms), so there's no reason
for them to stop covering you.
that's a lot different from at-fault accidents or theft-related claims,
which may be more indicative of claim patterns.

     The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux
did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight
fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the
first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd,
when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally
walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.

     The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has
not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning
about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he
has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.


>I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before

     The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba
has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher
from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With
Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed
reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that
Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck.
I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.

Check with the local fire department.  My buddy is a firefighter and they
have these small map books which are Amazing!  They are compact, easy to
use (no folding).  They even have a cross reference section in which you
match your current cross streets with the cross streets you want to go to
and it details the quickest route.  They gave me an extra they had laying
around.  But then again I know all those people I'm not really sure if they
are supposed to give/sell them. (The police may also have something
similar).

Thats not a typo. I think they sprayed on some kind of glue then blew

While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around,
Gant wasn't ordered back in the box sooner, he was ordered back immediately.
As soon as he stepped out, Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box.
Now, Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches.  The only reason
he did then because he was *very* bothered by the call.  I expect his
concentration wasn't there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it's
best to be as calm as possible.  Contributing factors would be Gant's
bad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring
drought.

Now, it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is
telling you to get in there.  You know the umpire is going to do something
(call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.

But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chip
he seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason
to want some time (disputed strike call).  Gant hadn't been wasting time all
game.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.
The score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.
Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little
slack?  For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the
game, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key
situation.  Did he have a date to get to?

And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game.

Not bad. We had a similar situation. Slowpitch softball, bases loaded,
weakest hitter at the plate. He hits a line drive over the third
baseman's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in
foul ground, almost hitting the fence down that side of the field.
But the umpire called fair ball! I was coaching third, yelling at evrybody 
to move up a base. The ump's position: it was still fair when it
passed third base. 
Why the other team didn't immediately protest I'll never know; we
certainly weren't going to argue about it, since every body did manage
to advance one base safely.

There was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner
from second base) leg, fielded by the SS, steps on second to force the
runner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire
called a triple play; protest removed when we won the game anyway.

I know this is the wrong place to post this, but I couldn't find any
relevant newsgroups in my area.

For those of you who are from PA, where is VASCAR (where the cops
measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance
between two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used?  I'm
especially interested in the Pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior
experiences, if possible).  For those PA and non-PA, if they use VASCAR
in your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc. 
What I'm interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk
of being caught.  You can always detect radar, but there's no way to
fight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are.

Thanks a lot,

You want to speed up ballgames?

1.  Enforce the two minutes between innings.  As it is, many fields are
    allowing THREE minutes between them.  Fifteen seconds before 
    TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon
    the return to the game.  Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or
    a ball is called.

2.  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it.  They may get
    pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher
    throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.

3.  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current
    rule is too lenient), and then enforce it.  Fifteen seconds is more
    than enough time.  If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball,

Now, my ego with regards to my shifting ability is as big as anyone else's, but
I just ordered my first car with an auto trans. I wasn't planning on it; but
after driving a few I was convinced: Things have changed since the days of 
Slip 'n' Slide Withe Powerglide. They shift *better* than I do, there's no
clutch to wear out (Honda wanted $800 for my 4WD wagon last year!- got it done
for $500), it only costs about 5% in gas milage on the highway and it makes it
easier to concentrate on all the radios in my car ;-)

(Oddly enough, while two of my best friends- both in the auto industry here in the 
Motor City- have switched wholeheartedly to autos, their wives *insist* on 
manual. Shift envy?)

Braggadocio aside, given today's technology and the warranties they're handing 
out the auto trans seemed like an excellent choice. Call me a convert.

Gee, I never knew Valentine made a comment about how Viola signing
with Boston was gonna bring a World Series title to Boston.  I don't
think Valentine ever said Boston will win this year.  Boy, talk about

In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why?
Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does
Toronto have?

His .300 season last year was good, but I'm not convinced that he can do
it again. It reminds me (sorry) of the year 1987(?) when Tim Wallach hit
30 or so homers and had 127 RBI. It never even came close to happening

The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang
and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the 
suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current
Cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior.
After the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided 
independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in 
a volume car.  

The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version of
the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Ford
is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will
power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably
do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority. 

Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new
Camaro/Firebird, IMO.  

I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will 
achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird.  The way GM loses money, the temptation
to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be 
great once demand really takes off.

	That shows how much you know about anything.  The brakes on the

Keywords: bbb arbitration lemon
Lines: 46


My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.  
The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but 
lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was 
defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below 
market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average 
retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but 
the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the 
fact that if you have an automobile that does not 
depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive 
to deal with you.  There is no way that the 
manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and 
sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded 
a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's 
representative at the hearing tends to support this 
point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not 
seem to take the proceeding very seriously.

I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am 
getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have 
to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon 
myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on 
the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to 
my elected representatives telling them how utterly 
ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for 
a use deduction equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  
As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying 
for my insurance.

Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton
HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 
this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems 
that required attention included the transmission, 
heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main 
problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They 
could not install a non-defective transmission in at 
least four attempts.

So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but 
you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you 
paid too much in the first place, or if your car 
happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.

A Yugo that will go 1/4mi in 7.7 seconds will _not_ lose on the

Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw
shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other
after-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or
Camaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_
MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or
Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than
the sticker price of either.

>Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of 
>the 5.0 that sounds in every hairpin turn ?

Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to
the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's
an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.

>And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...
>Hello , this is the 90 's ?

Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the
same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't
speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.

Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and
always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the
pony car class came from) with a performance model. That's
why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet 
accessible--with room for performance tweaking.

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,
and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least,
does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

Maybe I can help you. He's a major league coach with the Rockies.
So above prediction is doubly wrong.

My prediction: The Red Sox-Cubs Series and Vikings-Broncos SuperBore will
occur at the end of the world.

And one Rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this 
year.

And no Rockie starter will have an ERA below 3.50.

And the Rangers fade will not begin until...August. They'll give way
to the Angels. But still challenge to the end.

Personally, I follow the no alcohol rule when I'm on a bike.  My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike!  If I get hurt it's my own fault, but I don't want to wreck my Katana.  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*.  I had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00.  I wasn't even close to leagle intoxication, but I couldn't perform even the most basic things until 8:30!  This made



 me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication.  You may seem fine, but your reactions may be affected such that you'll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind.  I greatly enjoy social drinking but, for me, it just doesn't mix with riding.

Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).
Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have
the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.
I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably
only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters
for this reason during the regular season.

I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of
whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have
higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers
go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of
the platoon advantage).

Am I missing something here?

And not the only quality Mariner pitcher.  I logged on expecting to see
at least ONE congratulatory note for Chris Bosio's NO HITTER, but nary
a peep.  

So I'll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now 11-5 and
slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games
or even a hit in last night's gem.  

Not that we M's fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers
of New England's long-running tragedy, but only one winning season in
history is something of a burden to bear.  So we'll take our joys when
we can get 'em.  

The Mariners now have two no-hit pitchers on the staff and not
coincidentally those pitchers beat the Red Sox in back to back games.

No.

At least, that's what I told the NASA rent-a-cop that stopped me
because he swore I was lifting it up.

He didn't completely buy the part about water in the carbs, either.

Yeah, but I hate to follow them with the exhaust at ground level. Not all

As long as the Yankees are in the same division the Red Sox will
play better than .500 baseball.

Or the Red Sox can hire former East German swimming coaches to
train them at the fine art of body building. The Red Sox
can use Chinese women swimmers as a reference.

With the HAWK, the Red Sox definitely have a chance for the
east this year. He brings class, work ethic and leadership to
the park each day. And he has a burning desire to play in the
World Series.

Not everyone in rec.motoland is so easily amused.  Blaine, as an Elder,
has seen the Superflamers at their peaks (or depths, if you prefer).

Unless, of course, your audience has only seen several thousand similarly
uninspiring attempts in this arena.  In that case, the trite & boring

eventually (or not).

TWINS UPDATE --  Posted April 22, 1993  
---------------------------------------------
The Twins defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 today to conclude a three game
homestand with the Brew crew.  The Twins took two of three games in the series,
with scores as follows:

                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10
                                        Mil  0
                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)  

                  Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)
                                        MN   8
                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )

                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5
                                        Mil 4
                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)
                    Sa - Aguilera

Highlight/Low Lights of the Series:
------------------------------------
Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of
the American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0
with a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning
his ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with
Philadelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail
look like a true genius.

Willie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings
on Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now 
combine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are
0-5.

Wednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the
Twins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and 
subsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead
to 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing
4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.
Tapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike
Hartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and
the Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win
it.

Aguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown
saves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.
Coming into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,
then hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the
side.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.
Weak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.

General News
-------------------------------------
Pedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on
Tuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,
though, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former
Gopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.

The Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting
Pitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit
Tigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide 
quite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.

The Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,
the third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.

Brian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second
this year, and shows much improvement in this category.

Jim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he 
has the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch
out of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 
start.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly
in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the
rubber on the pick-off move.

not sure about there in CA, but here in US, the manuals are quite often the
standard equipment.  Of course, FINDING a car with one might be hard, but
if you read the sticker on the window, there is usally an additional 2k or
so tacked on for that lousy  tranny.  So you actually ARE paying more, just
that it's sometimes hard to find one that is equipped standard.  (this
applies to MOST cars, but not to the luxoyachts..eg caddilac, licolns, etc..)

Apologies if I don't know what I'm talking about :-), but as a Twins fan,
I like to think they have good players in any park.  Not sure if I remember
completely or not, but I think Gaetti played with the Twins in '87 for the 
world series, and again in '88 (note that's his lowest of the 4).  I believe 
the next 3 (or at least the last two) were played with the Angels.   Lots
of factors make a player excell...  I hate it when so many use the dome.
It may not be ideal, but nice to comfortably enjoy baseball and football

Mark,

  47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained)
'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.
All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings
and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers
to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was
mint.

   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k
miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.
There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.
I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all
said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.

   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain
it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my
VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.
Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

Good luck,

Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and
related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can 
predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall
performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)
that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated
predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This 
completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 
could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd
take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to
the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.

I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that
I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and
b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.
That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't 
have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you
run a simple least squares fit to the data you get 

(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.

The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is
significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the
fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to 
the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,
Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to 
add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.

It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the
low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it
could just be Ozzie.  The results:

                           RBI-HR
         Years        Actual   Predicted
Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6
Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6
Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8
Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6

I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that
RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall
and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

More later,
Harold

 A 68 Corvette but, I don't want to put Corvette seats in it.  The original
 seats are in exc. shape but they are uncomfortable as hell.  I'm going to
 store those and find a set to drive in.  I have all the Vette catalogs but
 I'm looking for a more generic type seat.  I can modify the brackets but 
 cushion height and overall width are a concern.  I've looked through some
 local boneyards without success.  I would just like to find a pair of 
 cheapo's to use this summer.

I've got a Belstaff tankbag on my FJ1100, and it ain't too good. It's
difficult to fix it securely cos of the the tank/fairing/sidepanel layout,
and also with the bars on full lock the bag touches the handlebar switches,
so you get the horn on full left lock and the starter motor on full right!!
If I was buying another I think I'd go for a magnetic one.

See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez
to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward
to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember
being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was
only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first?
Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was
there.  Sure, I say go for it.

I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas
was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/
Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.

BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.





>Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game,
let's compare our decision to one of the most Boneshead, right?

Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a
longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't
make the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior
history, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a 
career as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  -
laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess
Mieske has a future.)

(I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)

There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash.
The confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap
between the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify:

Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a
	living. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards,
	anyway) because they have never held education above basic
	reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their
	eventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant.
	(They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage
	of any group).

White trash: White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the
	word 'nigger' better than any black person I ever met, only
	with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell.
	-- my father. Genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under-
	qualified), good-for-nothing, dishonest, white people who are
	mean as snakes. The squeal like a pig boys in _Deliverance_
	may or may not have been rednecks, but they were sure as hell
	white trash.

White trash are assuredly intolerant of anything outside of their
group or level of understanding. Rednecks may or may not be.

Yeah, I had an XS750 that was the same. The valve seats tend to wear 
very slowly, and anything that might get taken off the pad (which shouldn't
really wear) will tend to compensate - so it's a sort of self-compensating
system.

Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net
with his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.

The way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I
used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,
and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent
average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I
compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and
here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the
system. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above
replacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;
1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks
substantially right.

In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I
had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of
.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is
Billy Ripken. I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the
same distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I
have set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs
are proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared
and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded
off for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:
Randy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo
Gomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)
in left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.

So, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and
fielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of
batting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,
30 batting, 25 fielding.

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

A lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster,
but the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used.  He is only
insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher
is injured during a game.     So to free up this roster
spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not
invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:

If the last roster catcher on a team is
injured during a game, the team is permitted
to substitute in his place for defensive purposes
a catcher who has previously been yanked from
the game.   

Given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster
catchers.  The 3rd catcher could be playing
in AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.

A guy who threw 240 innings with about .6 run lower ERA would have saved the
bullpen even more. Say, somebody like Frank Viola (238 innings).

Have you, by chance, taken a look at the boxscores from last year to
determine the accuracy of your account? I seem to recall Morris getting at
least 3 or 4 wins last year when the Jays came back from behind after they
had decided to pull Morris at the end of an inning.

O.K.  It would be a shame for Cards fans on the net
to go through the 1993 championship season without a 
mailing list to talk on so I would be willing to look
at starting one.

Except there's one little problem...

I don't know the first thing about how to do it or 
what it requires in terms of resources or time.  So
if some kind soul could e-mail me the particulars of
getting starting and managing a mail list, I'd see
if it would be feasible for me to start a Cards mailing 
list.

Thanks in advance,

I've been in two _major_ auto accidents, both were multiple car.  The worst
was a head-on three car collision (T intersection and one person ran a stop
sign).  In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go (and I saw it
coming both times).

If you _really_ want to add safety to _any_ car, simply add a cage to the
car.  They are available and cheap (about $500 in the USA).  Add to that
four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that
were otherwise not survivable.  but instead of people spending a little
extra money, we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal
level of protection for everyone. 

One other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get some
training.  This will improve your safety more than any other single
investment will.  Drive/ride defensively (and that does not mean you have
to be a doddering old stick in the mud).  People here tend to enthuse about
autos more than the average (probably in the top 15th percentile in driving
ability), but still we sometimes overlook the obvious.  I've been to two
driving schools, and three riding schools for my motorcycle.  A very
worthwhile investment (and besides, it was a lot of fun too ;-). 

Safety is what you make of it, just because a carmaker doesn't provide you
with an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go at
that.

     Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday
     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four
game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.
What could be better, declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs
are challenging?
     It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked, announced
Ryne Sandberg.  If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or
Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to
win.
     Lord, I hope we pull it off.
     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete
Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut
the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw
to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.
     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to
third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him
beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this
year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a
gap in right-center.  Cool Papa Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off
and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone
grounded out to second, ending the threat.  
     Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or
Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on
Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells
Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to
sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.  So came the
analysis from Frank Chance.
     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder
moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled
home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it
3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein
singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped
out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,
Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.
He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting
for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into
a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a
strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick
Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a
pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The
Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.
     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get
another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock
played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen
was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against
Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving
home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added
another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen
had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more
runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.
     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one
point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off
Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but
the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce
Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the
eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would
conclude their series with the Expos on Monday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st
     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.
The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the
all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first
first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of
first in this wacky season.
     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2
Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.
The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve
Rogers 3-2.  We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our
team speed, remarked Lou Brock.  I don't see why we can't win this
division.
     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of
the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,
now 2 back - but in 4th!
    When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a
pitcher's park like this, spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith
Hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,
and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.  The Pirates have made only
26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend
to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.
     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone
Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When
Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the
Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the
.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert
Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed
fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home
runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph
Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the
top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie
Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on
first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent
Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in
left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing
Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the
Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve
allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right
field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered
to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep
center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park
homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,
and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.
------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): 
    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants
managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting
pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,
once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming
week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.
     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and
the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel
faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer
haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.
Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don
Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had
one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's
doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the
National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.
They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after
retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but
faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.
     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the
first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the
Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.
The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to
three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell
Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather
good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the
trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of
course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the
outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.
     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two
home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray
Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel
Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was
scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after
10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working
his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and
Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,
and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the
Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly
emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):
     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the
wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in
the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  Normally, Drysdale remarked, I
would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford
to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't
afford to let the Astros beat us.  He then winked and said: Well, maybe
Davis will get decked once.
     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is
primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his
current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is
a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is
the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw
two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of
the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all
around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The
foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,
with center field at 420 feet.  It's as if some three-year-old threw a
tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit
home runs', remarked Roy Campanella.
     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize
the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,
Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,
according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the
Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with
a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the
Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to
erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened
to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.
Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.
     I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop, he explained.
     How can we do that, Pee Wee Reese wondered.
     They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to
throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I
want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with
a shallow infield almost the whole time.
     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight
innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran
pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and
third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The
Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan
Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando
Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'
thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.
     We're mostly a power team, remarked Ron Cey.  Jackie and, when he
plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other
plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I
guess that's why they're so successful there.  Indeed, it seems that
basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros
swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

Um, the header said *career.*  Hodapp managed about 3000 PA in his
nine years in the majors.

As for his consistently over .300, make that three years in a row, 
preceded by a part-time year, plus his last year, with Boston.  Hodapp
only qualified for the batting title five times.  

Was he injured?  He retired right around his 28th birthday.

Anyway, Hodapp put up flashy numbers the year *everybody* put up
flashy numbers.  That was his only really good year with a bat; 
his other .300 years were marred by a lack of power and an inability
to draw walks.  Only 163 of those 3000 PA were bases on balls, which
does not describe a feared hitter.  

On the other hand, he was part of the long line of famous Cleveland 2B:
Wambsganss, Riggs Stephenson, etc.

If he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the
one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may*
be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,
through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.
Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human
endeavor).

>that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that
>it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
>or better as a result, is absurd.

Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?
Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management
policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or
decrease available traction?  Braking?

It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum
swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most
of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency
situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.

>But by including countersteering

>the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.

I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which
teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner
that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the
course.

>And that was my original point.

Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that
point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a
rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous.

You're definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched
in between Clark and Bonds.  He must, and I mean MUST, get fastballs to
hit...otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise.
What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds, Williams, and Clark
3-4-5, the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing
abilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners.
I think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the
3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having 
Clark in the 5 spot.

It isn't that bad.  At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves compared
to the slab sides on the Consulier.  And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V-12
(thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together).  Also Ettore
Bugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the
development.  So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in
today's world.  Much like Enzo Ferrari's illegitamate son being allowed to
take over part of Ferrari as well...

That's funny.  I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about `cages'. 
:-)

Most GP 500cc motorcycles are V-4s, and the VF line of Hondas were all V-4s
(from the VF-400F through the VF-1000F, including the RC30 race bike and
the present VFR-750F).  It should be noted that Lancia built a V-4 in
recent history in the Fulvia HF, a very pretty Italian coupe.

I've experienced this, back when I was young(er) and (more) foolish...

My first bike used to track extremely true.  Going down the highway,
I would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas
steady, slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest, riding
without any hands.  If I needed to turn, I'd shift my weight into the
turn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars!
Granted, it wouldn't turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn
a bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input
to the bar normally associated with countersteering.

As I've said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any
input they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious.  Whereas that
may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances,
possibly for years at a stretch, I can't think of anybody who'd argue
that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar
in a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.

Except maybe for Mr. Sixsmith...  ;^)

I guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series (and, in
fact all year) have been pretty much consistently CORRECT.  Remember: the rule
says it's a strike if ANY PART of the ball passes through the strike zone.

I would certainly agree that  high strikes are not called (who could argue
this point?) but all in all I think in and out is called pretty well.

Doesn't work too well if the engine is hot, its more accurate to check the

I bought a Yamaha XS850 with 8K miles.  Over the last 2 years, I've put 30K
of commute miles onnit.  Valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every
5K.  Well every 7.5K or so, I've checked the pad clearences, and they never
change!  If anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which
makes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until the
clearances are too great right?  I know that threaded adjusters can tighten 
up, but I didn't think these kind could.

Bottom lines is that I haven't touched my valves for 30K on this bike and
they are still nice and quiet and if anything, the clearances are tighter...
What's the deal?  Any other Yam triple owners notice extremely long valve
adjustment intervals?

Well, red and orange were already taken. Maybe white defines the direction
that the car is moving in.


If you really want to be able to see behind you, get some fog lamps for
the back of the car. These work very well - and are a good way to get
rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone.

Yes, the stance is new.  Don Baylor was his batting coach at St. Louis last
year, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him.  Maybe Andres
has a weak left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the
ball.  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.  But the
change seems to have enabled him to hit the ball as well as 5 years ago.  His
selectivity has not changed.

Geico has purchased radar guns in several states, I know they have done
it here in CT.

I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico
for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped.  And once
you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high
risk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance.

My suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico!

Actually, according to the DA information posted by Sherri, Boggs is superior
defensively to have.  Here's their Defensive Averages for the last five
years: [compared to average at 3b, AL]

            1988        1989        1990        1991        1992
Boggs     .643[+2]    .659[+47]   .550[-54]   .653[+33]   .634[+32]
Hayes     -------     .601[-40]   .622[+18]   .606[-14]   .574[-28]

If Hayes is a defensive standout at third, he's done a good job in disguising
it.  To put it another way, compared to an average third baseman last year:

Boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs, turned 2 more double plays, and
prevented 11 doubles.

Hayes let 12 more grounders go by for hits, turned 6 more double plays, and
prevented 4 doubles.

I have a 90 Eagle Talon and I wanted a pair of GTS 
Headlight covers.  Actually, they are turning signal
covers since the Talons that year had pop-up lights.
I went to a auto shop and bought the tail-light 
blackouts for $45, but they did not have the turning
signal covers in stock.  I asked how much it would be
and he told me it would cost me another $40.  I thought
this was a bit high for two small pieces of plastic.
Can anyone find me a cheaper pair or even a used one?

Well, I've driven in every state but Alaska, and drive about 60k per year.
I take long cross country trips any chance I get - its fun for me and I
can get reimbursment.
My job allows me to drive rather than fly. Not to labor the point, but
I've driven just about every freewayin the US, Germany, UK and France plus
some in Mexico, which was surpisingly good.

Yes, but as a %age of the total freeway in the US? 
All you have to do in this case is mark the hazard, advising people to

Given the absence of other traffic and car built for 130 (e.g. 535) 
most US freeways are just fine. The problem is other road users and

Let's be careful here.  If players' performance was completely random
in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be
good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.
With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each
year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.
We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'd
expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.
This is what we actually get--

No. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5
Clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3
Coin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3

Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years
of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process
leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.
If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)
that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of
players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping
a coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above
or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from 
the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.
In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there
were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch 
situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of
those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two
years.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and
really horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, 
you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  

Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period
of years that could be used to predict any ability with any 
proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the 
caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage
that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein 
probably never had a clutch AB against a left-handed pitcher,
but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would
be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his 
platoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced
at casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into 
studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the
Elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow
you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better
than flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the
flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-
coming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.  The
authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance, so go bug
your local bookstores now, and maybe I can get enough to take my

That plastic bodywork is useless. That torque, and an upright riding position is
better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm
low torque motor.

To a cruiser-motorcyclist, chrome has some importance. To sport-bike motorcyclists
chrome has very little impact on buying choice.

Unless motivated solely by price, these are the criteria each rider uses to select
the vehicle of choice. 

To ignore these, as well as other criteria, would be insensitive. In other words,
no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser
rider may have.(sometimes it's hard for *any* motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements)
  
You're fishing for flames, Dave.

This difference of opinion is analogous to the difference
between Sports-car owners, and luxury-car owners. 

This is a moot conversation.

Disclaimer -- This is for fun.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called
stolen hits, defined as a play made that an average fielder would not
make with average effort.  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats
for the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as Plays Kevin
Bass would not have made.

OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff,
fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we
replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 49.4% out
making ability, how many extra hits would go by?

To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra 
Bases (doubles and triples let by).

Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or
DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't
take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article.

The short version -- definition of terms
HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell
NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder
NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.
DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

Why such a bizzare formula?  Basically, it's designed to be added into the
OPS, with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored.
The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

Well, there *is* a difference.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general
_decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'
curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a
room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 
5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.

Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have
a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold
place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.

Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.
As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating
temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).

In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember
that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or
something.

Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized
oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,
thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, 
but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  

If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine
(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,
stick to the 10W40.

Well, watching several Denizen's dismantle Laurie's Virago in an

I doubt Henderson would clear waivers.  And if he did, he would
instantly be signed for the major league minimum, with Oakland picking
up the remaining $3 million tab.

	Do you remember Game 7 of the 1988 NLCS, after the Dodgers defeated
the Mets, and Ugh-a-dugh foo-boo fat stomach Tom Lasorda came running out
on to the field in celebration?  YUCK!!!!!!
	He undulated.  His arms flew up and down, keeping time with his
rolling set of 9 stomachs, which flew all around the cozy confines of
Chavez Ravine.  He oozed, like a white gastropod.  He ran.  It was a 
disgusting sight.  Not only couldn't I watch my Mets in the Series, I had
to watch Fat Stomach Lasorda roll around Dodger....
	BLARGH!

>>But what made it memorable was what Karen eventually said about this,

	If you like short, fat men, who grunt, curse, and spit a lot,
Whitey's certainly your man - Former WFAN host Pete Franklin, on The White
Rat ...
	But it's true, this emphasis on the appearance of ballplayers in
tight uniforms only works if the player actually has an extraodinary 
physique.  Looking at Charlie Hough's scrawny torso through those tight
white shirts just sort of makes me decide, Hmmm, I don't want to eat lunch
today...or tomorrow...or anytime soon....
	When Al Harazin first became Mets' GM, he was asked if he intended
to help redesign the Mets' uniforms and change their image.  In particular,
they asked him about the orange and blue racing stripe that runs down the 
sides the uniforms.  He said that he's very much in favor of keeping them
because they're sleek and they're sexy.
	Sid Fernandez, in a tight-fitting uniform, with a sleek racing
stripe to denote speed and potencty.  Mmmmmmmm...lard.
	Kevin McReynolds, diving after a fly ball.  Mmmmmmmm...Man O' War, baby!
	Pat Howell....well, never mind.  Nothing could be tight on him. 
They don't make uniform sizes *that* small ... :-)

No... you can do this? Really? The other morning I went to do a lane change
on the freeway and looked in my mirror, theer was a car there, but far
enough behind. I looked again about 3-5 seconds later, car still in same
position, i.e. not accelerating. I triple check with a head turn and decide
I have plenty of room, so I do it, accelerating. I travel about 1/4 mile
staying ~200
feet off teh bumper of the car ahead, and I do a casual mirror check. This
guy is RIGHT on my tail, I mean you couldn't stick a hair between my tire &
his fender. I keep looking in the mirror at him a,d slowly let off teh
throttle. He stays there until I had lost about 15mph and then comes around
me and cuts me off big time. I follow him for about 10 miles and finally
get bored and turn back into work. 

I can file a complaint about this? And actually have the chance to have
something done? How? Who? Where?

That's the trouble: *what* peak years?  He wavers between excellent and
very good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there.  1979 was a fine
year; 78 and 80 were merely really good.  With the Yankees, 84 (I think)
was the best; that was the one with the .340 BA.  

Of course, 1992 wasn't bad, either.  He's been in the bigs since 1973,
with a one-year intermission for surgery.  Though he doesn't have the
mix of skills that Pete Rose did, he's like Pete Rose in one way: he's 
not a natural hitter.  Winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing
in New York, and that includes the Gulf+Western Building.  But his sheer
athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.  

Fascinating player to watch, even now.  Not obviously great in any one
way; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising
levels.

The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let
suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the
vacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough
to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, 
since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, 
and as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. 

One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side 
panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the 
correct size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output
side of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make
sure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum 
to the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check 
for air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is
a vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it 
flows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in 
the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog 
or partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced 
to fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control
hose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.

Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there 
is something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, 
I would be typing all day to list them all! 

Here are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve
and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the
airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are
quite a few on each carb.

I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American
Honda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and
call the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE. It is a 800 number, but I don't recall
it off the top of my head. I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days
later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked
the support I received, here would be your chance to tell them what you think!

Buy the service manual on the F2, it is an invaluable source of information
for working on your bike and I might add, trouble shooting!

Well Sherri, I'd agree with you except that most 'kiddies' have more sense than
to spew their obscenities in front of a group of adults..

I try to edit this newsgroup and feed it to one of the local elementary schools,
they have a group of students that just love baseball and are learning to use
computers, but I'm telling you, it's gotten to the point that I don't even edit
the files anymore, just read them and throw out the trash...  And thanks to all
you people that think it's wonderful to include a swear word or two in your
signature files, that's really nice...  I have to read the whole article and
then toss it out because of the .sig.  Don't get me wrong, I know all the words you
do, (and I've even made up some of my own!) or I wouldn't be able to edit them out ;^)
but this just doesn't seem to be the place, a public forum, to spew foul language,
sorry..

Thanks to all you people that keep in mind, there might be some decent, young
people, interested in baseball and computers reading this newsgroup..  They enjoy
your articles.

I grew up in New York City so I rode in many Checker cabs.  The jump
seats were fun as a kid.  Although the cars were roomy -- a good trait
for a taxi -- they had a design flaw that I don't understand they never
fixed: the rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when the
driver braked.  I wouldn't want to take a long ride in the back seat of
one of these vehicles.  Why did you like yours?  I never drove one, so

Hi Folks,

I recently bought a 1981 Mercury Capri (my first car ever!).
I have noticed a few problems with the car :

	1. It gives very low gas mileage (something like
           11 miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of
           gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).

	2. When I start the car, it goes into high idling (something
           like 1500 (or is it 15000 ?) rpm. After driving 4 or 5 miles, 
           it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm. 

I would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix these
problems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has
done about 117,000 miles). Someone suggested that I change/rebuild/
recondition the carburettor. I am not prepared to do it
unless I am sure it will fix the problem. And yes, I got the
car tuned-up recently (within the last 200 miles or so).

Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Please respond
by email since I don't scan this newsgroup regularly.

Thanks.

Regards,

--Sudhi.

True enough. I put it on the ground if it's free of spooge, or directly

Not exactly. The helmet has a lot less energy if your head isn't in it, and
there's no lump inside to compress the liner against the shell. Is a drop
off the seat enough to crack the shell? I doubt it, but you can always
send it to be inspected.

*nnnnnnnng* Thank you for playing, I cannot agree with this.  I believed
this and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!

I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just
couldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the
problems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the
ability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any
chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to
reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe
it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,
just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)
salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,
and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.
Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but
they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of
work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care
of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took
it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.

1988 Dodge Shadow ES

These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.

Engine 
4 Alternators
Rear Suspension Torsion Bar
2 Water pumps
5 thermostats
Hall effect sensor
Main computer
4 Batteries

These were rebuilt/repaired

Radiator
Automatic Transmission
Power Steering


Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For
about a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I
just can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I
traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I
just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000
worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite
me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are
going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the
hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.

You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but
Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I
feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler
product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I
will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM
isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do
their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  

Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a
hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car
is really good, until it has proved itself to me.

But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because
I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good
thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were
they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend
always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.

And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I
will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink
with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the
shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the
chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just
average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You
can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched
the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal
of information about this company, just because it is a new american
company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for
good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of
any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I
think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in
Toyota said and I quote, We are watching them very closely.  Come on,
everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been
kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make
a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to
set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They
are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the
ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,
but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's called
competition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the
consumer, well your out..

    For the last couple of years, the Braves have been fostering a program to reach to the Latin American audience.  This has included licensing Spanish fan magazines, encouraging Spanish co-broadcasts, and marketing programs directed at the Latin American community.  One of the biggest heros to the Latin American audience has been Francisco Cabrerra (a fact of which he was slightly embarrassed!).  

One funny story is that during Spring Training, the Braves played a game in Mexico.  This game was broadcast back to Atlanta in Spanish.  It took the broadcasters a few innings to get a rythm going because they had to keep changing their location.  Seems it took a while to find a place where they could get a clear signal on their cellular phones through which they were calling the game!

       The restriction could have to do with the car being a convertible.

 I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw
the other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/
early 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,
the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is 
all I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years
of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you
have on this funky looking car, please e-mail.

that Austrailian cars used Ford V-8 engines.  The Ford V-8 Interceptor
is, I think, a 428 c.i. cop car motor.  Whatever the case that small car

Hey all,


I'm looking at buying a new car, but I'm confused about the insurance
coverage.  This also applies to my existing car insurance policy.  Does
anyone understand what the Limited Tort Option means.  Will it lower
my rates if I opt to have it, or will it be more expensive if I opt
to have it?  What does it do for me (in layman's terms please)?  Is
it a good deal or should I ignore it?  I'm not the type to sue anyone
at a drop of the hat nor am I the type to report every little ding to
the insurance company as a vandalism claim.  Please help.



Thanks in advance.

record straight, Beamers are BMW motorcycles. BMW cars are Bimmers. Please,
let's get our terms straight.

Actually, some purists would argue that the only true Bimmer is a round
tail light 2002 or 1600.

Alright, that's enough. I've suffered with all kinds of insults (as
typical for the net), but give me a break. Galarraga is currently
batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing
enough walks.  What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000?
You can hardly claim that he is hurting his team.

If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen),
*THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches. My comment
that he isn't paid to walk doesn't mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it's more along the lines of: he's
batting .400 and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference
does it make if he isn't drawing  a lot of walks? Sheesh.

In fact, they make some ,but they just don't sell them here in U.S.

Sunny California is a 1.6l wagon based on Sentra.
Avenil is a 2.0l 4WD/2WD wagon .(It looks like Infinity G20 
but actually it's independently designed to be a wagon.I mean, it's 
not based on any sedans.) 
 
Nissan had better consider to sell them here.

Sounds nice. But I doubt they have a plan. Coz Avenil was introduced

I would be scared of trying to fit the one piece.  When I got my
two piece, I got the jacket in 42 and the pants in 40 (just due
to my manly-man of an athletic build, kind of thing)  No laughing,
please.  Seriously, I'm not trim and the 42 pants would have
been way too big.  Also, I don't think the 1 piece does provide
better protection.  If I'm wrong, I'll be swiftly if ever so gently
correct by the net.pansies.of.knowledge (as they like to call themselves).

For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush
the Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in
the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched
seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part
in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has
pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest
on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!

It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while
Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next
best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at
.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team
is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game
and giving up 6.6/game. 

Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should
come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave
the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, 
Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be
successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either
held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,
the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen
is a big question mark.

In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William
Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game
with California was cancelled.

But ingnoring putouts is biased in yet another way. Range is
not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman. The ability
to field all sorts of balls thrown to him: digging some out of the
dirt, stretching for others, and so forth is important. Thus, 
putouts do provide some information.  Maybe what we need is a
comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the
first baseman vs. how many he actually got.

Let me add my .02 in. I had a A/C installed by the Ford garage and it did not
work as well as the A/C that was installed by the factory in pickups 
identical to mine. I have talked to other people that have had the same
result. Don't know if this is just a probable with Ford or what??

	Yeah.  I don't use the clutch all the time either.  I've done it
with Fords, BMW, Datsun, and Chevy and it works fine.  I can't think of
any reason that it would damage the tranny.  Essentially you are just
doing what the synchros do anyhow - match the engine speed with the
tranny speed and slip it into gear.

	Sounds about right.  I usually slip it out during throttle-down
and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right
(usually about a second) and then slip it into gear...

Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which
is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some
interesting features.  This year, the predictions/team analyses for
the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics.  I
don't have the article in front of me, so I'll only give the memorable
ones here that I remember and know the melody to.  I could dig up more
if there is interest.

Yankess (to the tune of Subterranean Homesick Blues)

Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine.
George is on the pavement thinking 'bout the government.
Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off,
Says he's got a bad back, wants to get it laid off.
Look out kids, it's somethin' you did.
Don't know when, but it's Columbus again.

Mets (to the tune of Like a Rolling Stone)

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime, didn't you?
People said Beware Cone, he's bound to roam
But you thought they were just kidding you.
You used to laugh about, 
The Strawberry that was headin' out.
But now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud,
About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal....

Phillies (to the tune of Highway 61)

Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun,
Just keep them off of Highway 61!

Giants (to the tune of The Ballad of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter)

This is the story of the Magowan,
The man St. Petersburg came to pan,
For something that he never done,
He's sit in the owner's box but one...
Day he could have the Tampian of the world!

OK. It varies from state to state. It has to do with operating a vehicle
while there is greater than a given percentage of alcohol in your

If possible, I split lanes. Even if you don't get all the way to the
head of the line, at least you won't rear-ended. I always worry more when
I'm in the lane, at the front of the line, and no one in behind me. Then you
have to keep an eye on your mirrors. I also get ready to pull a hard right,
*just in case*.

     Quite right, your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain
most of their charge if drained and dried well, but I'd throw out the
electrolyte and buy some more when you need it.


     And before anyone says I'm wrong, remember that new batteries almost
always come ready charged and dry, and they are perfectly OK even after
several years' storage at the shop.

Quite honestly, this one is ridiculous.  Consider the following
scenario: Runner on third. As the pitcher starts to throw home, the
runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for
the suicide squeeze. The pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home,
but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down.  It is the
balk rule that prevents this from happening.  

Believe it or not, this actually happened to me once in an OBA
(Ontario Baseball association) game in Milton, Ontario.  I was the
batter and to my amazement, the umpire missed it.  In the 12 years
that I played ball, this was worst piece of umpiring I ever saw.

Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.

For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,

With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.

Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell
is he thinking.

Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year,
what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.

Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, 
The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home, 

I can't take this anymore

The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station, but doesn't come close to

WIP is rockin with sports talk from 5:30 AM till midnight, check it

mistaken, WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation?

Total Baseball, which also tries to evaluate a player's total offensive
and defensive contributions, gives Barry Bonds a Total Player rating of
9.0 for 1992. Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal
Ripken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive players
in the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; and
Larkin, 4.7.

The top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E. Martinez, 4.8;
Ventura, 4.8; Anderson, 4.5; R. Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4

In short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons
ever in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle,
Mays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the
writers of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and
neck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one
had the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseball
supports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992.

For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think
about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from 
Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated
at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to
the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay
pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used
a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.
	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front
fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube
frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to
do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two
vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing
follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.
The compressor is about 2 in diameter and about 5 long.
	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small
so there should be plenty of good places for it.
	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to
mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side
just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the
horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where
the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough
room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice
cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.
	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out
about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look
closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight
ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).
	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try
to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them
first.
	How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound
more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.
I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has
not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).
	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though
they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping
the pedestrians on the sidewalk.
The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to
those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)
and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.

the Indians.  But objectively, Alomar had the better offensive year

You admit T&P as a reliable(?), objective source?  Then you will note
that they rated Alomar as the better offensive player, chosing Baerga
over Alomar only because of his defense.

That's a joke!  (Alomar might not be a gold-glover, but he's certainly
no worse than Baerga defensively.)

   Hi everybody,

   I will buy a Honda Civic EX Coupe.  The dealer ask $12,750 for it,
including A/C ( installed ), but not including stereo, tax, registration
fees.  I live in Mexico, so I don't have time to go to a lot of dealers
and compare their prices.  The dealer is in McAllen, Tx.  Is this a good
price for that car ?  If not, how much should I pay for it ?

   Please e-mail ASAP if you don't want to post.  Thanks a lot.

During the local Rockies broadcast the other day Don Baylor
went out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came up
on the screen that it was the so and so sponsored pitching 
change. I saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored.

At other times during the game Rockies announcer Duane Kuiper was
setting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectation
that Charlie Jones would jump in and discuss the situation. But
what does Charlie do, he read's a beer advertisement and leaves
Duane hanging. Duane's strategy proved prophetic.

These examples happen over and over on radio and T.V. braodcasts
making them sometimes very boring to listen to.

I guess it's just a matter of time before a player sells his name
to  Budweiser, Nike, etc.

I don't think it will be long until we hear: Nike Budweiser drills

Aw, c'mon.  The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,
not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.
The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.

I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.
The first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.
This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I
contend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that
the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,
dinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate
flair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually
that it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and
boring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)

The other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has
a few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and 
tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly
identify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's
personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.
(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads
to a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.
Finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my
big dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which
actually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter
to my use and flamage in general.

In summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may
be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily
weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor
applicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a
flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your 
motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyone
who looks like you, too.

It did it again.  This morning, my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10,000 RPM.
Ok, so I exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2
liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would
cause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck).
What can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time to
time, but has straightened itself out - until now.  I don't have a tach,
but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast
as it should be.  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up
at a stop light.

Many thanks for any suggestions.

Be patient. He has a sore shoulder from crashing into the wall.
The Cards will give him all the time he needs to come around.
He is their full time centerfielder.
He will not however steal as often this year as he is hitting

What worked for me on my RD350 was to lean towards the dog as I modulated
throttle to keep my ankle just ahead of his teeth.  After a few seconds of
warm pipe firmly wedged on his shoulder he turned his face sideways to see
what was so warm and got his mouth/nose/muzzle burned on the pipes.  One
yip and he veered away, never to chase me again.

But, Gary, for certain sofa tubers like myself, this is an advantage.  I

Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem.
It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball
in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of
bell curve.  (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting
vs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly
there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My
*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently
(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might
be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players
(as opposed to all baseball players).

  As a counterexample to

You won't hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting
that you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also 
looked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),
hitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has
been traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting 
record is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would
not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based
on his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988,
but you may indeed be right.  

When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and
a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately
below his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.

This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having
with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical
history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before
it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply
statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?

I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find

basis?

(assuming David didn't know that it can be done one-legged,) I too would want

horribly bad form,) but for getting drunk?  That, I thought, was ones natural
born right!  And for spending his own money?  My goodness, who cares what one
does with one's own moolah, even if one spends it recklessly?

I would assume that the words (I saw the picture) indicated that those 
SEATS will not be available for baseball games.  If you look at the picture 
of the diamond in the stadium, in relation to the areas marked NOT FOR 
BASEBALL, those seats just look terrible for watching baseball.   Now, if 
they should happen to reach the post-season, I would imagine that they 
would consider opening some of those seats up, but that is surely a worry 
of the future.

Let's see what he does w/o the help of a pitchout every other pitch.
As I remember, even Bob Brenly had a good throwout percentage under
Roger Craig, who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown
out.  Of course, he suffered from 3 ball 1 strike homers a lot too.
I am not a big fan of Manwaring.

Well, this isn't the right group for this, but I have to say that I don't
think violence is any more socially acceptable now, by any means.  How
can you say that when we used to have of pistol-toting gunslingers as 
heros, or even gangland thugs being considered romantic.  Do you think
our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys
and indians?  I don't think so.  That behavior was somewhat encouraged
back then, in fact.
I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when
some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California, we here 
about it in MA the same day.  Back in the old days, they'd never hear 
about something like that, period.

Here's some important details:  I've been riding for ~11 years,
(my own bikes for the past 7 years), Michelle has been riding for the
past 6 years (her own bikes), I've only been involved in one accident
which was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign, I currently own
a BMW R90, Michelle owns a Yamaha Virago 700, we prefer cruising over
racing, we've toured a fair amount, we're both licensed and insured,
and we're nice people.

So, if anyone has a bike (or bikes :-), but the second one would have
to be a Virago or something else with an equally low seat) that they
would be willing to loan us for 3-4 days in July, Michelle and I would
be eternally grateful. In addition to our friendship, you would also
have the use of our bikes should you ever pass through Minneapolis.
In exchange, we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner
and an evening of wild bike stories, or we might even be willing to
cough up some money for improvements to the bike(s), like new tires or
something.

Also, any information about bike rentals in the Boston area would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Scott Brandt

Wetteland comes off the DL on April 23rd, and will be evaluated on the 24th.
He is throwing well, and without pain on the side.

DeShields is not on the DL.  He suffered from the chicken pox and lost
(this is the official total) 12 pounds.  He will be back, hopefully,
next week.

Walker will be back this tonight or tomorrow...

Here is a press release from the U.S. Department of Energy.

 Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel
Vehicles
 To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters
 Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806

   WASHINGTON, April 21  -- Secretary of Energy
Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on
Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a driving force
behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative
fuel vehicles and fuel supplies.
   President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for
federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the
next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for
in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
   President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner
Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to
advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order.
   I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make
this happen, O'Leary said.  As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has
helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet
to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural
gas vehicles in speeches across the country.
   The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending
a plan and schedule of implementation.
   The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead
by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a
practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,
O'Leary said.  Increased use of domestically-produced alternative
fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs.  We believe
that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy
economy are complimentary goals.
   O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to
coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with
funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA
to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make
fleet conversions practical.
   Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working
with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle
purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make
alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely
available.

 Seems that the 1993 Mustang 5.0 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford
 changed its testing procedures.  Under the older procedures, it still 
 rates closer to 225 hp.  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more.
 
 And you still haven't posted any weight figures for the Mustang.

 Yeah, sure, in your wet dreams.  And that's probably where you got 
 that 11.2 second 0-60 for the Stealth.

 For 3 posts now you've been harping on this May 1991 issue of Car & Driver

 ain't got the guts to admit it?  Yeah, thought so.

 No, I'm going to play your game -

       No way, Sentra's are SLOW!  I took a test drive and it took
       21.7 to go 0-50!  Why, even the Hyundai Excel blows it doors
       off.  Any 12 yr old knows that!  I race and I'll kick your butt! 
       blah, blah, blah...

 All it takes is one look.

Actually, I was simply relaying the reasoning of this so-called genius BW

Next time, before you say something foolish, be aware what you are responding

I am considering buying an new car, so I called three insurance
companies in California to get estimates. I asked for the same
coverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you
according to your zip code. Others charge according to your city.
Anyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's
what I found (for a '93 Integra GS):

AAA: ~$2000/yr.
State Farm: 2614.92/yr.
Allstate: 1220/yr.

AAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about
$200-300 back at the end of the year.

Still, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm
wants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be
suspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.

Any comments?

Even I noticed that Gant's demeanor was not one of a batter
attempting to regain his concentration.  Gant was stalking off.
I wonder if Gant said something to the ump?

Actually, there was a small hand wave by Gant...as if to say

My impression was that Gant was not 'stepping out.'  He was making
a protest about the lack of an appeal to first.  As has been
pointed out earlier, there is no appeal to first on a strike.
I can understand Gant feeling a little pressure in a two-out,
RISP, 1 - 0 game, ninth inning.  He let it get to him.  The ump
also overreacted.  Gant was stalking off, but I doubt he would
have been gone long.  Hirschbeck should have let him have a
moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat.
IMHO, umpires should be more flexible than what Hirschbeck
showed.  Gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely
he would not get a hit.

A very bad finish to a pretty good game.

Wait a minute.  If I read the rules right. A stike is ANY portion of the ball 
over ANY portion of the plate.


Given that the ball is ~ 2.9  in diameter.  This sez that the zone width
is ~= 17 + (2 * 2.9)  or 22.8  . While this is still less than the 23 
number given.  I can forgive any UMP for misjudging .2 on an object moving
at 85 to 100 miles per hour many times not in a straight line.

I think the Umpires Union has a great grasp of the rules!!!

Something else to consider:

Alomar's H-R splits were .500-.363 SLG, .444-.369 OBP! Baerga's was .486-.424
and .392-.318. Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park.

I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P
rated Baerga higher, actually.

Well, I would guess the probability of a BMW driver having a gun would
be lower than some other vehicles.  At least, I would be more likely 
to say something to someone in a luxosedan, than a hopped-up pickup
truck, for example.

Re: Waving...

I must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers while
riding does a lot of good things to my mood... While riding is a lot of fun by
itself, there's something really special about having someone say to you Hey,
it's a great day for a ride... Isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time
on the road on days like this... with a gesture.

Was sunny today for the first time in a week, took my bike out for a spin down
to the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about 20 other people who were
down there for similar reasons (there's this GREAT stretch of road on the way
down there... no side streets, lotsa leaning bends... ;) ... Went on an
impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who 
I didn't know, but who were my kinda people nonetheless.

As a fellow commented to me while I was admiring his bike... Hey, it's not
what you ride, it's that you ride... As long as it has 2 wheels and an engine
it's the same thing...

I don't understand this at all.  Matt Williams has demonstrated
throughout his career that he will NOT wait for good pitches to hit.
He won't take walks.  He'd rather swing.  If I'm the opposing pitcher,
why would I groove a fastball to Williams and have him hit it well,
when I know that Williams will swing (and miss, or at least not hit
very well) at a low and away curve?

Something that happened in South AFrica about a year ago: A dealer sold a 
Mercedes with an odometer reading of 150K kilometers to a lady. Turned out 
that the actual reading should have been 160K. Court case followed because
lady said she wouldn't have bought a car with that much km's. Dealer found 
quilty, fined and had to take back the car.

I think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous
owner. Take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something.

And DoDers are easily recognized by their own special wave.
Pay attention and I'll tell you how to do it. Hold your left hand out
in front of you, fingers straight but apart - like a vase. You may also
use your right hand if you have a throttle lock or are stopped. Bring
your fingertips and thumb together, touch, and open back to the starting
position. While you are doing this, move your hand slowly to the left.
Do it gracefully and with a waving motion. You are now imitating a
squid propelling itself about underwater probably in search of food,
drink, squids of the appropriate sexual orientation, or other squids to
go riding with.

No, that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city.

Unless you have an accident, you won't need more.  If you plan on
paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card
automatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may
cover rental cars also.

Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and
require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  The
credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of
coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.

I have never rented from Alamo, so I don't know if they follow this
same practice.

>Is the beretta a good rental car?
Yes.  It is a compact 2-door, probably a bit dull performance and
acceleration-wise, but very adequate.  It will have an automatic
transmission, AM/FM stereo, air conditioning, and possibly power 
windows and door locks.

For an expansion team?  I'm pretty sure I would go with the rings, as long
as their salaries and ages weren't too high.  I would want the fans to be 
able to identify the players.  I would like a championship attitude in the 
clubhouse.

As for Larkin and Griffin?  Salaries aside, I would have to consider which
player is likeliest to contribute to a WS victory.  Past performance, age and
attitude would all be integral to my decision.  I certainly wouldn't just
haul out my copy of Gillete and pick Larkin, as many others would.  And,
unlike many others who post to this group, I hardly consider myself quali-
fied to make those kinds of decisions.

Will they?  You can't usually take away one of the team's best
players and still expect them to win.  Or do you think the 
Pirates will continue to win without Barry Bonds.

So. Again, Jack Nicholson gets paid much more than most hard
working citizens (and much more than Rickey Henderson for that
matter).

The reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks
start making the real big salaries late in their career, when they
are on the decline. (There are exceptions, of course. Dave Parker
fell apart after making his first million because he put most
of that million up his nose.)

my motivation for setting up the BMW list came from an earlier post of

Yo, did anybody see this run of HARD COPY?

I guy on a 600 Katana got pulled over by the Police (I guess for
speeding or something).  But just as the cop was about to step
out of the car, the dude punches it down an interstate in Georgia.
Ang then, the cop gives chase.

Now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!!
Everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet
battle at about 100mph.  What happened at the end?  The guy (who is
being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights)
slows a couple of times to taunt the cop.   After blowing a few stop
signs and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street.

The Kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance
machine and he slams on the brakes.  Of couse, we all know that cages,
especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our
high performance machines.  So what happens?...  The cage plows into the
Kat.

Luckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt.  But
dude, how crazy can you get!?!  Yeah, we've all went out and played
cat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!!  How crazy can
you get!?!?!  It took just one look at a ZX-7 who tried this crap
to convince me not to try any shit like that.  (Although the dude
collided with a car head on at 140 mph, the Kawasaki team colors
still looked good!!!  Just a few scratches, like no front end....
3 inch long engine and other minor scratches...)

If you guys are out there, please, slow it down.  I not being
an advocate for the cages (especially the ones that make that 
annoying ass noises...), but just think...  The next time you
punched it (whether you have an all mighty ZX-11 or a I can
do it 250 Ninja), just remember, a kid could step out at any   
time.

Peace & ride (kinda) safe.

think about how you make them feel as well as how you look (you spelled

For years you have assaulted others with offensive language, etc.  From

1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer
setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves.

2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are:

a) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP
sign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the
pegs until you tell her to get off the bike.

b) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough
that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And
(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as
possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your
balls up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.

c) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't
lean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.
Don't look over your shoulder.*

3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That
means don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than
usual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have
the equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,
so be prepared for that.

4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't
have to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.

5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things
of interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get
so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives
her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.

* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended look over the rider's
shoulder in curves bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of
her weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,
unlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the
pillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain
perpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someone
else on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.

Hello Folks,

I'm very happy with my new R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...
that's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting
something rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much
anyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still
(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe
I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are 
my questions:

1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the
wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds
(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my
vision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece 
detachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.

2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it 
really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators
don't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM?  

3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section
of the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? 

4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any 
particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?

Thanks,

You are not alone.  My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started  
showing the same behavior.

I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost  
about $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to  
rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would  
have cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.

The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  
engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  
part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  
rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   
Wow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  
the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.

This is quite easy even for a beginner.  My local auto parts store had a repair  
manual for the Honda Accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake  
cylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.

This seems to be a popular scam with dealers.  Last month my brother bought 
a new Audi 90 series quatro from a local dealer.  They came back with the 
final price, tax and all, and he added it up for himself.  There happened to 
be an extra $300 tagged on under the tax part. He pointed out their error 
and asked them to re-think their addition.  They came back with the right 
price the next time.

Every week or so it is dead and I have to recharge it. I ride the bike 
every day, the battery is new and the charging system was checked

somewhere. 

Do you have any idea about what is causing this problem?

Many cars sold here in Finland are *small* and *cheap* cars (at least when
compared to other cars --- note that we have over 120 % car tax).

And you couldn't expect a good auto mated to a 1.3 L engine?

Most of the bigger cars are, however, sold with autos.

Yes.  Unfortunately, there is also the concept that the owner of a car
is not responsible for the actions of any (authorized) user of the car.
That's one of the biggest arguments against photo-radar ticketing
systems.

Trouble with that is, you then have no recourse if a mis-issued ticket
or a clerical error on a computer follow you around.  The City of Chicago
(the informal motto of which being The City the Works) issues dozens
of parking tickets each year to people who have never set foot (or tire)
in the city.

An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.

Owww.

Well, I hate to be a wet sock, but, well...

I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started
riding myelf, and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  The passenger
seats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't
even usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my
back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the
reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had
a BMW. :)

I'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains
or some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.

The best advice I'd give a beginning passenger:

- Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort
  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on 
  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop
  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.

- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider
  asks you to :)

- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements
  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,
  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.

- Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably
  consistent shifting style).  Avoid helmet bonk.  Helmet bonk is 
  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change
  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It
  gets old real fast.

- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep
  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands
  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,
  but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.

- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be 
  sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're
  still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.

- Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or
  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed 
  for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.

Look, guy, I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving, but if
he's been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to
lighten up? I mean, it isn't like most of us haven't had a few
and then ridden or driven home. *We* just didn't get caught.
And I can speak for myself and say it will *never* happen again,
but that is beside the point.

In answer to the original poster: I'd insure whatever vehicle
is cheapest, and can get you to and from work, and suffer
through it for a few years, til your rates drop.

And *don't* drink and drive. I had one friend killed by a 
drunk, and I was rear ended by one, totaling my bike (bent
frame), and only failing to kill me because I had an eye
on my mirror while I waited at the stoplight.

This is a very simplistic view of safety. Assuming that you are in a collision
(less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor
is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. This is why a thousand
pound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why
everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 (as I recall for the last
generation Suburban HIC numbers). 

As an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? It seems to me that
seatbelts with pretensioners (Audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt 
will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. You might be

saved from some flyign glass? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator
safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are
wearing no seat belt?

Spike is owned by both Tom and I.  We went 1/2's on the purchase price
and have split costs of needed parts, registration, etc.  Both names are
on the pink slip.

>I also note that you lay no claim to Connie or Ol Sport. (Like I said,

I am covered by insurance to ride the Harley.   I'd give it a go if
I could work the clutch.  I can barely get the clutch lever to move
using both hands while standing next to the bike.  Ol' Sport is a
very distinctive bike.
The Concours is favorite of mine.  I've pillioned an easy 4000 miles
on that bike in the last year.  Unfortunately, my feet are a good
10 off the ground once I'm on her.  No way I could take her for a
ride as pilot rather than pillion.  If I could fit on a Concours, I'd
buy one.  IMHO, the best sport-tourer made.  I'm not _too_ upset
I had to settle for the Ducati 750SS as my touring bike, though. :-)

Not to mention that Lankford had been hurt two nights before running

I beg to differ, he had a couple 3 hit games after he came back.  He did

I went to a place called American Car Care Centers to check my car for A/C
leak.  After checking, I was told that there is a leak in the compressor
seal.  At the end, in addition to the labor for the check, I was charged 12
dollars for a pound of freon, although they evacuated my A/C afterwards

We are working on gas-solid adsorption air-con system for auto applications.
In this kind of system, the energy for regenerating the adsorbent is from 
the exhaust gas.  Anyone interested in this mail email me or follow up this

I basically agree, the Tigers are my favorite team.  Actually, their
pitching might actually be better this year than last (not that htat's
saying a hole lot). How 'bout that home opener on Tuesday!! By the way,
Sparky goes for win 2,000 today.

With all the recent problems the Indians have been having
with their pitching staff I have heard numerous names
thrown around about who could solve their problem.

One name I have not heard is Mike Soper (RP).  As far as
I know, Soper has had pretty good minor league stats.
Why not give the kid a chance?  Anyone know anything about
this guy?

You make it sound like this behavior is new.  It isn't.  A lot of
pedestrian bridges have fencing that curls up over the sidewalk to
make this kind of think a lot harder to do.

I don't understand the mentality myself, but then again I couldn't

Talking about car alarms, there are certain cars in this country that are 
only insurable if they are fitted with a Vecta alarm. We're talking Coswoths
and Porsches and stuff. Just before they (the insurance companies) decided to 
make this move, they insisted that the car be fitted with a Scorpion alarm (
now they've changed to the Vecta)... so everyone who's spent $$$ on fitting 
the Scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the Vecta system.

I sold my '86 Sprint last April with 95k on it.  I'd driven it since
the previous July, putting 20k miles on it.  The sensor light used to
light up regularly, starting about 5k miles after I bought it.  
My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment,
so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement.  Performance (hah,
if you could call it that) did not change.  Perhaps emissions increased,
but how much emissions could a CA-registered 3 cylinder engine produce?
That was a neat car, I held the engine block easily in one hand!  Has
anyone ever driven the 'Turbo' variant?  Just curious...

  That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about
prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of
Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked 
at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they
were 24, and noticed some interesting things. 

  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in
the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the
majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that
they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers
lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  
found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and
produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first
group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away
the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. 

  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory. 

  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight.

Greg,

    The story goes like this:

       Spanky is too slow!  If he were quicker, he would still be here.
But with Slaught and Tom Prince, they didn't want to lose Prince in order
to bring up that 11th pitcher.  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
Prince is coming along nicely!

      Don't feel too bad for him.  He's still gonna get theat $4,000,000
over the next two years -- he'll be able to do most of what he wants to
do.

A similar thing happend to me a year ago.  I bought a used Ford Bronco
(which has since been stolen...  :(  )  and few weeks after I paid
and took delivery, they sent a letter telling me they goofed and 
miscalculated the license renewal by $300 and that I need to send
in a check to avoid further delay in the processing of my registration.
The thing is, I had already received the pink slip from the DMV, so
I ignored it.  I received another letter and then the phone calls
started coming.  First from the finance guy and then from the general
manager, both hounding me for the extra money.  They left me alone
once I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause
in the contract that stated that the final price was just that: FINAL.
Afterall, they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another
$300 off after the deal had been signed, right?  I told them not 
to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future.
They didn't seem to have a problem with that.  This, after all, was a
used Ford at a Toyota dealership.

I had a much better experience buying a new Pathfinder about a month
ago.  It certainly pays to buy a car on the last Sunday of the month.
It was even raining too, so they had done very little business that 
weekend and were really willing to deal.  I kept telling them I would
think about it, and they kept dropping the price.  Got a very good
deal and so far have been very please with the service.

Why not? Horner played 130 games in 1985 and hit 27 HR.
Murphy played 162 and hit 37.
In 1986 Horner hit 27 in 141 games and Murphy hit 29 in 160 games.

I had the same problem in my '90 MX-6. Luckily I had it fixed

Same thing to me.  Everyday the same dog would chase my bicycle.
The owners thought it was cute.  Even after I got the moto,
the stupid dog would do the same thing.  Then one day, I was
coming home in the opposite lane...the fluff with teeth ran to
get me and played momentum sharing with a 73 Dodge pick.
The owners tried to blame me for driving down street when I did.
I lived in a wierd town.

My suggestion look at your current insurance card, there will be a name 
accross the top telling you which insurance company you are insured by.
Call information in Houston and get the number of a branch office in the 
Houston area, call the insurance company.

Your rates will vary depending on the amount of coverage you want,
do you want to carry comp and collision (probably not on an 82),
what your driving record is.  You mentioned none of these things in your
posting so how can anyone give you accurate information.

Like I said, pick up the phone and make a few calls, it won't kill you.

I like my Wrangler, but when doing some serious off roading, it can't

  I am selling my trusty Husky... hopefully to buy a Husaberg...  This is
  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had
  any problems with it.

  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than 
  a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better 
  suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non
  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.
  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear
  changes.
  
  The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike
  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a
  custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect
  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced 
  by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up
  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better
  ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.

  So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg,
  which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.

Haven't been to many A's games, have you?

Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts
a long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don't
like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going
on in that game.  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or
pitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow
walk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason
(Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of
reach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).  

I want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoy
watching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much
dead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch
it on television, because they're busy showing you replays).  I don't like
that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game
(the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next
year: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next
year, and they're going to a 35 second clock).  

There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm
watching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person.  For me, going
to an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not
willing to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A's
revenue from me.

i think that automatics have advanced far more than manuals.
especially in shift intelligence.  i say that a smart automatic is
better than the majority of drivers in terms of being in the right
gear at the right time, which to me is more important than torque
converter losses.

>I prefer the stick for fun and the auto for traffic.

who says you can't have your cake and eat it too?  a well designed
shifter will easily facilitate manual, clutchless shifts.  i am
referring to the much copied mercedes jagged gate.  the only
department where you lose out is in the number of ratios available,
and of course the converter losses..

if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission,
it can't be half bad..  :-)

This morning a truck that had been within my sight (and I within
his) for about 3 miles suddenly forgot that I existed and pulled
over right on me -- my front wheel was about even with the back
edge of his front passenger door as I was accelerating past him.

It was trivial enough for me to tap the brakes and slide behind him
as he slewed over (with no signal, of course) on top of me, with
my little horn blaring (damn, I need Fiamms!), but the satisfaction
of being aware of my surroundings and thus surviving was not enough,
especially when I later pulled up alongside the bastard and he made
no apologetic wave or anything.

Is there some way that I can memorize the license plate of an
offending vehicle and get the name and address of the owner?
I'm not going to firebomb houses or anything, I'd just like to
write a consciousness-raising letter or two. I think that it would

usual 3.

You'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an SHO--the Taurus
is a front-wheel-drive vehicle...

I went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker
than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO.

Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers. That is not to
say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg
disabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an
SHO anyway. 

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all performance-type cars (like the 5.0l
Mustangs, Camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of
accidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans,
but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO.

I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car.  I purchased it via
some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would
run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car.
Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger.
Believe it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and
energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just
sitting.

Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun
wasn't strong enough due to its low angle.

I think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more
expensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.

I've never used it on the bike because I have an E-Z Charger on it and
keep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.

It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out-
accelerate an Integra.

But, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars have
a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?  No wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power
sliding roofs that are opaque.  A moonroof that can be opened to the air,
closed to let just light in, or shaded so that nothing comes in.

The politics is so dirty because the stakes are so small.

Who cares? I get my dues-worth from the ads and occasional technical

	What used to peeve me in Canada was the cars with bloody _red_ rear
indicators.  You'd see a single red light come on and think, Now, is he
stopping but one brake-lamp is not working, or does he have those dumb bloody
_red_ rear indicators?  This being Survival 101, you have to assume he's
braking and take the appropriate actions, until such time as the light goes
out and on again, after which you can be reasonably certain it's a bloody _red_
rear indicator.

Apparently that last post was a little hasy, since I
called around to more places and got quotes for less
than 600 and 425.  Liability only, of course.

Plus, one palced will give me C7C for my car + liab on the bike for
only 1350 total, which ain't bad at all.

So I won't go with the first place I called, that's
fer sure.

The Red Sox usually have 2 catchers.  I don't think they have a backup now,
but they used to use Randy Kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle
infielder and outfielder.  You don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a
competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick
a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field.

Bricklins were manufactured in the 70s with engines from Ford. They are rather  
odd looking with the encased front bumper. There aren't a lot of them around,  
but Hemmings (Motor News) ususally has ten or so listed. Basically, they are a  
performance Ford with new styling slapped on top.

OK, the Mets and O's are good examples, but what about the '90 Reds?  Do you
really think that anyone expected them to sweep the A's?  I know people who
didn't even think they'd win a game, let alone win the Series.  We proved 
them wrong, though, didn't we?

As for this year, ignore their record now.  They've had a rocky start, and
that has nothing to do with Colorado.  They shall rise again.  The hunt for
a Reds' October continues. (with all due respect to WLW)  Bye.

Was it just me, or did it look like Hirschbeck pointed to
the 3B umpire before calling that strike?  I thought that's
why Gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire;
he thought Hirschbeck had gotten checked-swing help from the wrong
umpire.

After Hirschbeck called for the pitch, but before the pitch was thrown,
Cox came onto the field.  It was obvious that he was trying to get time

Your listing pretty much agreed with what I saw, with the aforementioned
addendums.  Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark.  Personally,
I was amazed that Gant didn't get ejected.  But that's why Cox did;
it's called protecting your players.

And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game,
all I can say is that you'd be making baseball history.  Even in
the worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are
ejected, not everyone who comes onto the field.  And I'd have to 
say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game
 than what the Braves did Fri. night.

Anyhow, that's my last two cents on the subject, barring
outrageous postings.  I will try to keep my eyes open
for more incidents involving Hirschbeck. I think there will
be some with other teams as well.  I hope not.

The clutch on my '92 Honda Civic EX-V (EX in the U.S.) does this too.
It's annoying.  Now that I think about, it _is_ worse when the humidity is
high.  The dealer also claims there's nothing they can do since the clutch is 
a self-adjusting hydraulic design.  Yeah, right.

Turbo boost is necessary if a turboed car.
Fuel reserve warning.
Coolant level warning.

It would also be nice to have a gauge that would cycle across the different
sensors in the FI system such as O2 sensor, altitude, Air Flow...

I'd love to get Tranny and diff.
Brake temp would be great...

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much
better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater 
feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and
140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best
of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time.

The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000
kms is no better. Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection.

A little delayed, but in the interests of fairness (stats from Elias);
        BA    OBP   SLG  R  HR RBI RNI  %   outs
Alomar .310  .405  .427 105  8  76 264 20.5 419
Baerga .312  .354  .455  92 20 105 316 21.2 480

So we see that Baerga has a large advantage in RBI (runs batted in), RNI  
(runners not driven in) and outs.

I've only ever done it in an automatic. I was sitting in my Olds, in
the winter, at a light, when I heard screeching behind me. I managed to
dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half
where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was. I've never
had occasion to do it on a bike, but I imagine that it would be even
easier, because you could slip beside the car in front. Giving a gander
at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch
out smoothly when you notice trouble, instead of waiting for the
screeching.

I am looking for recommendations for a good (great?) Alfa Romeo
mechanic in South Jersey or Philadelphia or nearby.

I have a '78 Alfa Spider that needs some engine, tranny, steering work
done.  The body is in quite good shape.  The car is awful in cold
weather, won't start if below freezing (I know, I know, why drive a
Spider if there's snow on the ground ...).  It has Bosch *mechanical*
fuel injection that I am sure needs adjustment.

Any opinions are welcome on what to look for or who to call.

Email or post (to rec.autos), I will summarize if people want.

I'm no Kingman fan.  Just thought I'd point out that he's the
only player in history to have five three-HR games.  Joe Carter
has four.  Eddie Murray three.  McCovey and Gehrig also three.
Ruth, Mays, Foxx and Dawson two each.

I don't think Reggie's WS game counts, else I believe he would

Sure, I can. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, edited by Erwin 
Tragatsch, was published by The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited, 
Astronaut House, Hounslow Road, Feltham, Middlesex, England.

It was first published in 1977, and mine was reprinted in 1978. Cost then 
was Pounds 5.95 in the UK, though I paid 18.50 for it in Canadian 
dollars. I have no idea whether it's still in print. Perhaps you could 
let the net know.

    At the beginning of the interview Torre also said Lankford is the

    My guess is Jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low
    on base percentage.  Whiten was a great acquisition... decent offense
    and great defense in rightfield.  But don't worry, Gilkey will be
starting        
    as soon as Jordan or Whiten displays an extended period of low offensive
    output.

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.

>I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P
>rated Baerga higher, actually.

Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

Yeah, and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career?
It's actually not an uncommon phenomenon, and how long a guy hangs around

Good point on Cedeno. OTOH, I haven't seen that extensive list of 10-year
Dan Gladdens, either. There really aren't that many players altogether who
hang around for 10 years even if they're reasonably good.

and also for Baseball America.

Stark has done this sort of thing, but he has never been serious about it.
He usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of 
such columns. I think he did it one season and some manager was projected 
to be thrown out of 60 games and some hitter could expect to be plunked 
150 times.

Stark does some really funny stuff. His weekly baseball reviews are good 
collections of strange things that happened during the previous week. He 
also regularly prints Kinerisms.

No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when
(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.
The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max
Friz's famous design, but with an overhead point cam (see below for
more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground
clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so
that the ground clearance was substantially increased:


      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)
                 Viking motor (front) ->   \=@=/

This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved
around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn
in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting
rods to accomodate the stroke.

The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still
unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and
and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was
required to drive both overhead valves.

Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a
pressurized stream of oil to power the waterwheel which kept the lobe
spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal
engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to
normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,
resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a
little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the
beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to
pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,
uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).

Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively
firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily
lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even
higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This
was feasible because it was a racing engine.

With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers
because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an
almost perfect point:

                    /\
                   /()\   <-lobe
                  / XX \  <-complex linkage (not shown due to
 valvestems ->   / \  / \    complexity)
                |  |   | |
                |  |===| |
                    =0=  <---piston
                     |
                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical
                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the
                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the
                             curvature because there was none in the
                             head itself. The bore curve would start
                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in
                             this diagram


The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of
the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of
finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the
name.

The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it
worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary
technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that
racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines
were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate
(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two
Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and
down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as
twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern
record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle
historians discount this story.

Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.
They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they
want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!

A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
 recent offensive level of performance.  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in
 the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger
 in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived superstars, who
 get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably
 considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.

One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in
pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media
magnet).  The Reds made a lot of money off that; they also wasted the prime
of Eric Davis.  That may be good business, but that doesn't mean I don't
loathe them for it.

	I'd hate to rehash an old thread, but...  Would someone kindly quote
a prices that a dealer quotes for a Civic EX, and Escort GT.  Also, I'm a
assuming that the MX-3 was the V-6, so go ahead and look that up, too.  If 
someone has one of those yearly buyers' guides that give a low quote price,
please quote them, too.  Then find the the SC1 base price.

Thanks.

There is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of <93 probes.
Complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals.  It is
a known problem, present on most (if not all) pre-93 Probes, so you 
shouldn't have to pay them to fix it.  In my case, they fixed it on
my extended warranty (I just had to pay a $50 deductable) (the
work was valued at something like $185 with labor and parts).  Having
removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions, I think their estimate
was fair.

Their phone number is 1-800-377-9777. The last catalog shows three 
Oaks jerseys: 36 Home, 42 Home, 39 Home - they're each $165.00.  All their
merchandise is handmade and is an authentic replica.  I own a couple -
and they are excellent. They also have wool caps and jackets.  You should
call to get on their mailing list even if you can't afford their prices.

All Toyotas have airbags with a real horn. Come on, how hard can it
be to put a little pressure plate there. I hope Toyota doesn't follow

One of my brothers had spent a lot of time practicing bizzare tricks on
his megabuck/micromass bike. He said he once repelled a dog attack by
picking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the
head with the rear wheel. The dog had _no_ idea what hit him, and he
fled quite rapidly. Then again, he could jump garbage cans without a
ramp, so I don't think I'd care to try this one on a motorcycle.

>The telephone worked much better than the tire pump.

That's almost unfair, I've never seen a dog that could use a phone. :-)

	No way -- gotta be Walter Johnson.  All were with Washington.
Carlton spent too long in St. Louis to collect less than 700 there.

	Fingers had to have achieved 100 with either MIL or with SD so, yes,
I'd go with that guess.  Otherwise I was thinking that Reardon has a better
chance of having 100 with MIN along with (I would think) easily reaching 100 
with MON.

	Hmmm...Leary is a really good point.  I'd forgotten about him.  Well,
if nothing else, there are plenty of ex-Met pitchers in the category of
could have lost to all teams -- Koosman, Leary, Torrez, Ryan, Seaver....
I guess the best three guesses would be Leary, Ryan, and either Seaver or
Koosman.

I don't know.  You tell me.  What percentage of players reach or 
exceed their MLE's *in their rookie season*?  We're talking about
1993, you know.

If that were your purpose, maybe.  Offerman spent 1992 getting 
acclimated, if you will.  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season.  Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.
Do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant?

For a stat-head, I'm amazed that you put any credence in spring

are you going to tell me that it doesn't make a difference?

Wait a minute.  I missed something here.  First, forget Keith
Mitchell.  Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA
and then does not improve would have been better off making a
direct leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then
does not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't
belong in the bigs?

Now, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)
he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was
returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now
his career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your 
point.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now
he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.
Duh.

Well, I've cast my lot.  Certainly you may understand better how 
good Lopez is.  And I may overvalue experience.  But neither one
of us runs a baseball team.

The DeLorean had the yucky PRV V6 engine. A joint-venture between Peugout (note 
spelling), Renault and Volvo. PRV. This engine is a *MIGHTY BORING* piece of
junk with approx 140hp. Doesn't like revs at all.

If you look at the DeLorean in the movie Back To the Future you will note
that they changed the engine sound to a big V8. A real DeLorean doesn't sounds
half as good. You will also note that every time they have to spin the tires
in the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean can't make
a burnout on a dry road! The weak engine thats mounted over the rear axle
makes it almost impossible.

After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HD
Slash cut pipes I installed my new Bubs (which I had been planning to
do anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with no
problem at about 97 dB.

Two points:

First, I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. 
Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and
doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced
the dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, make
sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from
the body.

Second, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific. At low revs or cruising
through town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats
a more throaty, purring, rumble.  When you open her up to >3000 RPM
they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. Best of both worlds!

There's plenty of legroom on the Kawasaki KLR650.  A bit
short in the braking department for spirited street riding,
but enough for dirt and for less-agressive street stuff.

There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.  I thought
I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  I splurged
and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the
highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, like
Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch
of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a
cost of $1 million for the lot of them.  The total team salary is 
$7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.  If that's too steep,
you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and
a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one
of the best teams in the majors.

My best advice would be to contact a local dealer (see the yellow
pages under Motorcycle Dealers) and ask for the address of the local
section BMW Owners Club.  The local BMW dealer will give you details
of the BMW Insurance terms and the club will help you with all
details.  Getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet, if you can
afford it.  The warranty is fairly handy as BM bits are made from
solid gold, apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum.  Apparently.

Not really, though I wouldn't personally say the most deserving
candidate wins.  Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid
season, and there have been several duds in recent years.  But this is
more a factor of mediot biases than anything else.  (I wonder.  If

I think they are a second-division team.  They should finish ahead of
the Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics.  But I don't think
they'll be above .500.  (I think the East is stronger this year.)

Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible.  This
year their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad.
Even if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in
Abbott.  Sanderson?  Farrell?  I don't believe it.

And while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their
offense lacks punch.  They don't have any bona fide power hitters.
(Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis?  None with more than 20 HR
potential.)

Cheers,
-Valentine

P.S. Which AL team had the most steals last week?  Those go-go Tigers!
The mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed more
balance in their lineup.  You see, they were scoring too many runs
too consistently.  Gotta run more to break that up.

GM, at least, is heading in that direction.  One of the post-sale
questions they asked me was if I'd like the choice of a cigarette
liter or an accessory plug, and another whether I'd like the choice of
an ashtray or a cup holder.

The '93 Geo Storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option
(which did not exist in the '92 I bought) -- I'm not sure about the
ash tray vs cup holder.  It's a step in the right direction.

The ashtray does make a convenient change-holder so it's not
completely useless.

	The term stopper is generally used to refer to a pitcher, one
who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going
on a losing streak.

	The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description,
although right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.

	What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper,
somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump.
There's just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best pure
hitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster
has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.	

	Oh, and another thing that worries me.  Ron Gant seems to have
slowed down a step.  That's scary.  A slow Ron Gant doesn't have much going
for him.

I don't buy this at all.  I think things are colored to a very large
degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are.  Try
this exercise:

XXX is pitching today.  His team scores 4 in the first inning, and 3
in the fourth.  XXX gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th.  In the fifth,
he gives up 3 runs.  In the 6th, he gives up 2 more.  The score is now
7-5, with XXX's team still on top.

I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be he is
a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win.

If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be he is an
inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch.  Needs more
seasoning.  Send him to AAA.  Or to the spice rack.

So what will happen when the tv contract runs out, considering networks
have been losing money on it?  Either ticket prices will go up, or someones
salary will be cut, or perhaps the local community or merchindise could make
up the difference.  Baseball is probably facing a dramatic drop in income
very soon, and someone will suffer (probably the fans from higher ticket
prices, but definitely someone).

YESSS!  You make me proud to
be an 'Merkun.  Good thing you
didn't get shot though. Don't
try that with a good'ole boy in Texas.
I once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off (I was 
in my car) after I had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic
and senseless.  All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks
back (he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since the
freeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, Stick that
finger out again and I'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your
sorry-ass throat.  I stared straight ahead, unblinking.  A hundred
cars were honking.  Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red
with anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him, 
waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...  I'm glad he decided 
not to shoot me.

Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom. 

As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was
a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They
said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low 
numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked
great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! 
It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  
I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those 
who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  
( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should
be road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about 
the transmission and taking my chances.

Being a reletively new reader, I am quite impressed with all the usefull
info available on this newsgroup.  I would ask how to get my own DoD number,
but I'll probably be too busy riding ;-).

No one should EVER rely on just a magazine to determine what car they
buy, I don't care what magazine. Btw, I subscribe to three other 
auto rags, I just think CU is getting a bum rap by these macho men
from hell who think real men should read . . . .

Statements like what you said above have no meaning. People keep on
saying CU is only good for dishwashing detergent or as you
said:Relying on Consumer Reports . . . . is like. . .  and that is
all they say. 

If there were as critical of themsevles as they are of CU maybe there
would be some real content.

I think the only thing to watch for is the number of attachment

tankbag and because the rear of the tank is so narrow the fit

Oh, well... I have to admit that the most disgusting feature of
Volvo's is their marketing. It looks like Volvo uses something like
Do you dare to risk your family in any car? attitude, which is quite
annoying in the long run.

But now Volvo has produced a new  good car, the Volvo 850. Front drive,
2.4 L 20 valves motor, completely new chassis etc. Even the British magazine
CAR liked it (and believe me, that is quite much for a Volvo). And
the American magazine Road & Track said that This is not your uncle
Olof's car, and in a positive sense.

But in any case, I'd still like to own the 960 estate. Strong, tank-like
chassis, 3.0L inline six, rear drive. :-) :-)

BTW, the only car drivers who have blocked me are Land Rover or Jaguar
drivers... :-) :-) :-) :-)

What? You mean what I drive? A cheapo Japanese (a Toyota) of course,
I do not have money for a *car*. (like BMW, Merc, Jaguar, Saab 9000, 
Volvo 850 (or 960), etc)
If I had the money, I would have *bad* problems deciding which one
to buy :-) :-) :-).

Um, what?  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.

Winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently
on several occasions.  

Dave Kingman's *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry's *typical*
year with the Mets.  

Darrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which 
*is* all that Kong did.

Whom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that's
because he's 38 years old.  He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.

Not.  

Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better 
than anyone else ever has.

Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't 
noticed.

One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.

That's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the 
Hall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been
excellent.

>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential

No, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?
Not really.  But he obviously belongs there.

The Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As 
more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  

And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,
etc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability
throughout most of his career.

Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know
what you mean.  

As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters
tend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't
lead MLB history in walks allowed, either.

The 91 and 92 Cruisers run the 4.0L straight 6 which only has about 150hp

If you take them on rough trails, you'll see the difference.  The Cruiser
is an order of magnitude better in off-highway ability.

Well, I used to get mad, and either try to communicate my anger to jerks,
or to, uhm, educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic.
Now I just try to get them off my tail.

In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in
front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the 
jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch
into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a
better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than
from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.

In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass,
I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name,
(still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.  

If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps 
(for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get
my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.  

A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for
me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case,
yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a
cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike. 

On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last
vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk
waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing
illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).

Like almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary.

Well, apparently once you get past about 6 inches, all the luggage shifts back in the panniers, the passenger slides back, and the dog ends up hanging onto the top rack,
and they go all the way over until it's flat on it's ass, with the front wheel
straight up in the sky.  Impressive, but hard on the tail lights. :)

A month?  Well, he did have a short career--compared to what one might
have expected for such a highly touted prospect--due to being injury prone,
overweight, and having no work ethic.  But he certainly did not
suffer from being rushed to the bigs.

New Integra supposedly wedge shaped again.  175 hp and all-wheel drive
in top models.  Then a variant called the zx-r comes later. (roadster?).

i think it gets unveiled at end of summer.

This is a phenomenon known around work as ready-fire-aim. I am astounded at
the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only
don't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. In fact, there's a
plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins.

For the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save:
He must finish the game and either
1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck.
2. have pitched at least three innings effectively.
A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game.

But this is an argument that *wins* is a dumb stat, not saves.

This again doesn't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your
post.

Germans are just more organised; you can't blitz all of Europe in a
matter of , what, 9 months, unless you're pretty organised. If we tried
that, there'd just be a whole bunch of tanks backed up at the border,
waiting for some jerk in the right lane trying to get over to make a
left turn.

This, of course, caused Germany to invade Belgium. One of the important
lessons of history is that anything, including late afternoon
thundershowers, will cause Germany to invade Belgium.

About a year and half ago when I first started riding, I took a MSF course. I
have taken those lessons to heart.  Over the past year I have had only a few 
near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels.  Yesterday I got to add
another to the list but with this one I felt the most helpless.  I am sitting
at a light about 1 - 2 car lengths behind a car, a wise decsion.  Suddenly I 
hear screeching tires.  I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the 
moroon flying up right behind me, in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the
bike.  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel.

I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident?  Suggestions?

Difficult on front. Easy on rear. They are not expensive. about $75-$100
for front and less than $50 for the rear.

Its also kind of dangerous to work on the front springs without the
proper equipment.

Summary: Two or more vehicles... discount?

Lines: 26

Hola amigos,

Quiero... I need an answer to a pressing question.  I now own two
bikes and would love to keep them both.  One is a capable and
smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great
brakes; the other is a Beemer G/S, kind of rough for the city but
great on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, but
I don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is going
to pluck me by the short hairs.  

Unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  They
do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of 
driving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage

anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to
discount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.

By the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes
there, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebody
guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson
they only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,

Hey Valentine, I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their
fingers.  Damn, Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his 
future.  Therefore, I would have to say Toronto easily made the best 
signing.  And don't tell me Boston will win this year.  They won't 
even be in the top 4 in the division, more like 6th.

Here in Australia most cars are manual (privately owned anyway).  Why?
Not sure, I think it has something to do with the fact that our car industry
in the past was more closely aligned with Europe than the US in the past.
Now it's aligned with Asia.

Now, now, before we get too carried away here....

Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling
class can afford.  Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason
to levy a tax on car ownership; last I heard, there were seven different
fees to pay to own a car.  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic
inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate.  Basically,
I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds
wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  In exchange, zaibatsu's like
Hyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle.
I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone
else, but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society,
of screwy components that won't work together.  Stubborn like a mule, the
car either won't go forward or won't stop at all.

There is a fine line between getting players' input and knuckling
under to players' demands.  A manager, much like a military officer,
needs to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect during
a game.  After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time 
to do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team often
falls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) )  

Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like
demands.  I suspect that a comment like I enjoy hitting fourth; I'm
used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if
it came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,
I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best
in that role.  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems like
a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question 
like, How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?
A more media-sensitive player might answer The manager knows what he is
doing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I
am all for it.  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a
little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.

Personally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't
matter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted,
except for personal stats.  If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer that
question, The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get
paid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing
to hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team.  or something like
that.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was
hitting third--and make him sound like a team player.  Since Strawberry
will not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for
his next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   
his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.

Remember, the media is of the belief that one's best RBI man should hit
fourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it is
true.

I'm plannig to trade my Sentra SE-R in with a NX2000.  My car has 11,500
miles on it and is a '92 model.  The NX2000 the dealer is selling is a '91
model with 23,000miles on it.  It has a T-Bar Roof, a/c, and an airbag,
which my Sentra does not have.  They are asking for $1500.  Is that a fair
deal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not
seem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical
engine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine
to it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's
engine is a little tight.  So, if I buy the NX2000 and excercise it
well, should that slight power problem go away?  Any advice on this will be
much appreciated.  Thanks.  Please reply via e-mail if possible.

In regard to Boggs:  I'll relate a story about a Yankee fan at Fenway last year
for opening day.  I was there to see them face Baltimore and couldn't help but
listen to the Boston fans talk about various players on the team.  One guy was
totally obliterating Boggs, how he sucks, etc....  I told him I was a Yankee
fan and I'd take him in a second and who would he want in a trade back.  He
said a pile of sh*t.  I know Boggs had some personal problems while playing for
Boston, but come on he's a future hall of famer who really adds a needed
dimension to the Yanks.  A solid hitter, a decent fielder and more importantly
a teacher, ask Pat Kelly.  I think he's got a few good years left in his bat
and may be a key contributor down the stretch as they win the American League
East this year.  Boston fans have no class!!!  They'll probably boo him like
crazy his first time back in pinstripes and I hope he goes 4 for 4 and shuts
them up.

Makes sense, since the new Mercedes Benz engines go from 2.2L-4 to a 2.8L-6.
Nothing in between.  BTW, I beleive the numbers on those MB engines are
156 and 225 hp respectively.  The one-upmanship in hp might induce BMW
to create a larger six.  Also, the 2.6 190E has lagged behind the 3-er
2.5 for some time wrt hp.   I am sure the Bavarians wouldn't want to be
shown-up by the Schwabians.

PS- those MB engines haven't been released over here yet.

The big win with the V-1 is not its range but rather its
directionality and multiple-transmitter tracking (which you later
called a gimmick -- a conclusion I disagree with).  Since the
detector incorporates multiple receivers it's not surprising that it's
significantly more expensive.  While the added capabilities may not
help you, there is added value for those of us who live in areas where
there are a lot of false-alarms.

I certainly call it interesting but I'm another person who thinks
that the added value might be coming at too high a cost.  Very
adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and
one of them has suited me rather well.  If I did more long-distance
travelling in areas I'm not familiar with I'd probably consider
getting the V-1 because it's additional information would be useful in
discriminating false alarms.

	Ahh Broncos.  Well personally, I have a '78.  The blue book is just
a hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650
front end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkable
and blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000)
2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out
of a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were 
free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers
i took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask,
but it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear
axels, ford 9 and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i 
busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and 
haven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to 
rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones
that might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly
TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were
as the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective
wheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few
dings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops were
discontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top
for 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don't ever break the window if you
have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over
400 bucks to replace.  My bronco also does pretty good offroad,
i haven't bottomed out my suspension, YET, and have crossed over
3 foot deep of water with no problems, handles rocks like a charm too.
One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or a
Toyota, between two rocks or trees, and your grandmother will have
a hard time getting up into it.

I don't actually have the answer to this one.

Bosio, after walking the first two batters, retired 27-straight for a
back-end perfect game.

How many other games - including extra inning games - have seen a pitcher
retire 27 straight, excluding official perfect games?

The only other instance of this I know about for sure is the famous Ernie
Shore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in
Cooperstown. Shore came into the game when Boston Pitcher Babe Ruth got
thrown out for arguing over the first-batter walk; Shore picked him off and
retired 26 straight after that.

I'd like to hear stories on experiences with the Hyundai Sonata.  I
know Consumer Reports has trashed them but the people I know that
have them swear by them.  They also haven't had the problems with
them that Consumer Reports claims.  I haven't driven one yet.  I
have driven a '93 Hyundai Elantra (which Consumer Reports also
trashed) and was very impressed with it.  The local Hyundai
dealership (no-haggle policy) is offering an Elantra GLS w/ power
moonroof for $13163.  They also have a Sonata base, w/ Sunroof for
$13997.  I know my preference is for a Sonata GLS w/ sunroof and
4-spd automatic.  I'll decide which engine I prefer after test
driving both the 4-cyl and the V6.  The Sonata is also offering a
$1500 rebate.  Hmmm, that's another question.  Is the following
scenario the appropriate manner to handle negotiation?

1.  make offer
2.  subtract rebate from offer
3.  talk trade
4.  subtract trade from offer to get final price

Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding for

     - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have
       to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the
       car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I
       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my
       visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your
       taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright
       white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)

     - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually
       about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give
       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.

     - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors
       *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see
       any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out
       of the way *now!*

     - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line, I
       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from
       behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-).
       I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice
       that there's something in the lane ahead of him.

Now, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line
that I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line, your forward escape
route is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that
you don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line
(although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up 
next to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decided
that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.
Any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind
you?

	Sorry to be contradictory, but... I've had my Nighthawk at 45 degress
with the horizon and I wasn't banked over in a turn...  
	The hard part is getting the front in off the ground.  I rev to about 
7,000 at DROP the clutch.   Even harder is keeping it from coming up to far--
I use the back brake as well as the throttle.  Once its up, it'll wheelie just
like any other bike.

Having driven both, and having owned an SC300 for 14 months now, all I can
say is it depends.  They're both great cars.  In fact, my wife and I
are saving our pennies so we can get her the 300ZX convertible in a year.
The 300ZX handles like a dream, while the SC300 rides like a dream.
Fit and finish on both are excellent, but the Lexus gets the nod in
customer satisfaction.  They're both very attractive, and hideously
expensive.  The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX.  The
300ZX isn't available with traction control, which makes it a handful
on slippery surfaces.

>So the question I have is HOW DANGEROUS IS RIDING?            

Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more
dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the 
activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot
faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is
not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective
clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,
you are likely to be less severely injured.

First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,
this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach
control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.

Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet
and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy 
piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking
boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine
for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay 
tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps
are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the
pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,
preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for
a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though
more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another
thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand
leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.

Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after 
drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement
and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions
are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding
in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, 
brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,
tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or
otherwise not in average shape.

With care, you should be ok.

I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.
Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If
you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as
low as a 300-400 cc bike.

Possible models: 
The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally
inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to 
weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier 
problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.

The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series
I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of
standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.

Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know
them as well.

For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to
buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective 
clothing and insurance and licensing costs.

Hope this helps,
-David

	The word is subrogation.  Seems to me, if you're willing to wait
for the money from scumbag's insurance, that you save having to pay the
deductible.  However, if scumbag's insurance is Scum insurance, then you may
have to pay the deductible to get your insurance co.'s pack of rabid, large-
fanged lawyers to recover the damages from Scum insurance's lawyers.

	Sad, but true.  Call it job security for lawyers.

So what does that have to do with RBI's?  The team with the most RBI's
doesn't necessarily win the game.

Yes, runs are the most important statistice -- for a *team*.  (So why does
every newspaper rank team offense by batting average?)

But for an individual player, runs and RBIs are context-dependent, and tell
us very little about the player himself, and more about his teammates and
position in the batting order.

	Hahahahahaha.  *gasp*  *pant*  Hm, I'm not sure whether the above
was just a silly remark or a serious remark.  But in case there are
some misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his data
file on Korea since...mid 1970s.  Owning a car in Korea is no longer
a luxury.  Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do
have at least one car.  The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is
that there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and
buses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is
no place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration
wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide
his or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan.

	Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only
car manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and
I believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such as
Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still
quite expensive.

	Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics
and bureaucracy.  He's quite uninformed.

By the 1920s, there was a very active good roads movement, which had
its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up
steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so,
and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916
that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent
roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic
transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were
crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty
of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly
expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the
first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good
books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco America on the
Road (title may not be exact - author is) and another called The Devil
Wagon in God's Country author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or
John Bell Rae's auto histories.

As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early
teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel
on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the
right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller
instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I
don't know why.

I can't help myself.
I've tried to be rational, 
to look the other way,
but everytime it happens, 
its uncontrollable.

I hate pre'80s motorcycles.

At first I thought it was a phase.  I though I would
get used to them.  It didn't happen.  I tried gazing
at CB750s and 900 customs, but each time I sadistically
pictured them being hurled off of large precipice
(I also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering and
taking holiday snaps, but I can't figure that part out).

What am I to do?  Everytime I read a .sig containing 
some spoked wheel wonder, I shudder and feel pity that
the poor soul has suffered enough.  I imagine the owner
scrapping out his (or her) living in a discarded Maytag
refridgerator box, tucked in next to their CX500.

I'm hoping for some deliverance.  I had in the past loathed
the Milwaukee machine, but I can actually begin to understand
some of the preaching.  There must be hope.

G'day people,
	
	Are there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why
my MR2's engine sounds noisy? The MR2's engine is noisy at the best of times, 
but not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises. 
	I do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine
noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month
mark, after an oil change (I've been tracking this very thoroughly for months
now) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving,
but more so during idling. 
	What's its problem? 
	Also.. I don't know if it's just me, but if noticed a little
performance drop. It just hasn't got the acceleration it used to. 

	Any help/tips would be appreciated!!

Anti Freeze

I was wrong, still had the issue of Street Rodder in
my last pile. In the February 1991 issue on page 24 there
is an advirtisement for anti freeze.
 
AND IT MAKES A GREAT PARTY MIXER
The Neo Synthetic Oil Company has a reputation for
developing overkill priducts the protect and extend
the life of mechinical things, and here is there latest
development. Propylene Glycol, probably the finest radiator 
coolant available. After 100,000 miles of testing, they find
it has a boiling point of 365 degrees (much higher than
conventional coolants)- which helps elminate detonation and 
pinging, it allows the use of smaller radiators in race cars,
it will not damage aluminum blocks or heads, and it is 
environmentally safe. Yep, this is the good stuff.

Damn right. I was late for a climbing meet one morning, so I got
out of bed without bothering that my right foot was still asleep.
It reminded me by folding underneath with a crunching of Metatarsals.
Lucky the brake's on the right, but i got funny looks riding thru 
London with one leg held aloft.

(Climbing wasnt a problem - the best splint in the world is a tight
climbing shoe.)

Um, you gotta understand these salesdroids as you call them.  They look at
it this way: burn lotsa tire; make lotsa money.  I'm sure s/ he knew how
stupid the HG was.  Would you seriously stop them from burning off 
a seasons worth of tire??  The SQUIDS probably would buy Metzelers or some
good low profile tire anyhow...

Yep.  Them droids sure a sneaky bastards! ;)

This is fascinating.  You say that Alomar was the better hitter last 
year, and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that Baerga
had a better year.  The only category that I see which shows an advantage
for Alomar is OBP.

I've heard *unconfirmed* rumours that there is a new Integra being released
for '94.

Does anybody have any info on this?

The local sales people know as much as I can throw them.

Hello again.

Anyone here done any tinting work.  What are the best brands out there?
How about applications...I heard there was a water based brand that s
you can move around, till it's just right, and you then let it dry like that.

Also I would consider having it professionally done, how much around
Wisconsin or Chcago area, that does a decent job, fairly cheap. (college kid)

Thanks for all the info...

Ps.  What is the maximum legal tint limit.

I just got a K75 and had the heated grips installed.  As far as I can
tell the grips look and feel the same as the standard grips. 
They are *not* soft.  Last weekend I did a 500 mile round-trip and
got to a point where it was in the 30s and raining.  Those heated
grips were *great*.  I've only had the bike a month and the heated
grips are already one of my favorite features on the bike.

Save youself the cash.  Take it from a BMW mechanic.  Idiot lights are for just that.  Buy yourself a ballpoint pen and write it down yourself.  Change your oil every 3000 mi. and you will be just fine.

	Follow the regular service intervals in you r book also.

                      PRESS RELEASE
 TO::  ALL BMW RIDERS
 SUBJECT:: RALLY TIME IS HERE
 FROM:: BMW CLUB OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
 
 BMW 49'ER RALLY, MAY 27-31  (U.S. Memorial Day Weekend)
 San Francisco Bay Area - 20th annual BMW 49'er Rally, sponsored by
 The BMW Club of Northern Califronia,  will be held at the Quincy, 
 California Fairgrounds, from May 27-31, 1993
 
 	Included in the $42 pre-registration fee, $47 at gate, are 4 Star
 camping, field events and trophies, two dinners, rally pin, door prizes, 
 Poker Run, vendor displays, Fun Run, English Trials, and live music playing
 throughout the weekend.  Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse
 D'Elegance and more.
 
 	This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the 
 event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,
 The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more
 complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our
 two most favrite highways- Highway 70, which goes through the Feather River
 Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's
 Highway 49.
 
 	Day passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a 
 pre-registered guest of a BMW rider.
 	
 	The Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89,
 two miles South of downtown Quincy.
 
 	For pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug
 Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA
 94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195

 ADDITIONAL NOTES:: 
   This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.
   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one
   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so
   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.

   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.
   For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa, 
   Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.
   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.
   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. 
   Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early
   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays
   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday
   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the
   awards ceremony.  

   For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on 
   registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course
   be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider < betting 70 +
   needed to win> and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15>.
   and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.
