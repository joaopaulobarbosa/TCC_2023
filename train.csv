Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Ethics;University of California, Davis;Beginner;This course gives you context and first-hand experience with the two major catalyzers of the computational science revolution: big data and artificial intelligence. With more than 99% of all mediated information in digital format and with 98% of the world population using digital technology, humanity produces an impressive digital footprint. In theory, this provides unprecedented opportunities to understand and shape society. In practice, the only way this information deluge can be processed is through using the same digital technologies that produced it. Data is the fuel, but machine learning it the motor to extract remarkable new knowledge from vasts amounts of data. Since an important part of this data is about ourselves, using algorithms in order to learn more about ourselves naturally leads to ethical questions. Therefore, we cannot finish this course without also talking about research ethics and about some of the old and new lines computational social scientists have to keep in mind. As hands-on labs, you will use IBM Watsonï¿½s artificial intelligence to extract the personality of people from their digital text traces, and you will experience the power and limitations of machine learning by teaching two teachable machines from Google yourself.;Machine Learning  personality  case study  footprint  Big Data  ethics of artificial intelligence  computational social science  ethics  research ethics  digital footprint data-science data-analysis;0
Solving Algorithms for Discrete Optimization;The University of Melbourne;Advanced;Discrete Optimization aims to make good decisions when we have many possibilities to choose from. Its applications are ubiquitous throughout our society. Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions on the use of scarce or expensive resources such as staffing and material resources also allow corporations to improve their profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.  This course is intended for students who have completed Advanced Modelling for Discrete Optimization.  In this course, you will extend your understanding of how to solve challenging discrete optimization problems by learning more about the solving technologies that are used to solve them, and how a high-level model (written in MiniZinc) is transformed into a form that is executable by these underlying solvers. By better understanding the actual solving technology, you will both improve your modeling capabilities, and be able to choose the most appropriate solving technology to use.

The Making of the US President: A Short History in Five Elections;The University of Edinburgh;Intermediate;As Donald Trump takes office as the forty-fifth president of the United States, this course explores presidential elections in historical perspective, via five case studies. It tells the story of key campaigns in US history, and by doing so it investigates how politics changed over timeï¿½and how understanding the past sheds light on the current campaign. From the arrival of dirty politics to the impact of the digital revolution; the course looks at the historical background to some of the key phenomena that shaped the controversy-laden campaign of 2016.  The five elections that we'll investigate are among the most significant in American political history. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson won the presidency in a contest that encouraged politicians to reform the electoral college, the system by which presidents are still chosen. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted the outbreak of the Civil War. It's an election that helps us to understand the development of political parties. In 1968, the Vietnam War was a dominant concern for Americans, and yet foreign policy played a secondary role in Richard Nixon's victory. Twelve years later, in 1980, Ronald Reagan won an election that initiated a new era of conservatism. Finally, we'll turn our attention to the election that took Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, to the White House in 2008. Many saw the Obama's success not only as revealing the impact of the digital revolution on campaign politics, but also as signaling a turn to progressivism.

Leading People and Teams Capstone;University of Michigan;Beginner;The capstone project will consist of three options, and you will complete one of them as part of the course.  The first option is working with senior-level executives to help them solve their most pressing leadership challenges. Two (2) senior-level executives from leading organizations will provide detailed descriptions of ongoing leadership challenges that they are currently facing within their organizations. The challenges will be real and current. You will be asked to help the executives think through how best to approach and address their respective leadership challenges. Specifically, you will be tasked with drafting a memo to one of the executives outlining your recommendations for how best to address the leadership challenge. To offer effective advice and counsel, you will need to use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the fundamental issue(s), and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations. The memos will be evaluated based on how effectively you apply course concepts to diagnose the problem and how well you link your proposed solutions to the diagnosis. The best submissions will be sent to the executives for their review, and each executive will offer feedback that will then be shared with the entire class to advance everyoneï¿½s learning.  The second option is to identify your own leadership challenge (e.g., at work, at school, in your local community). You should be directly involved in the challenge, and the challenge must align with at least one topic from the specialization. You will develop a presentation where you use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the core leadership challenge and barriers to effective performance, and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations for your own leadership challenge.   The third option asks you to interview an executive of your choosing. In this interview, you will ask questions about the challenges faced by that executive with respect to leading people and teams, as well as the practices used by the executive to address his or her challenges. In your written submission, you will use course concepts to organize the major leadership challenges faced by the executive, highlight the strategies and practices used by the executive to address the core leadership challenges, and then to evaluate the effectiveness of the executiveï¿½s practices related to leading people and teams.  You can expect to receive staff feedback on your assignment 4 to 8 months after you submit your assignment.;Project Management  presentation  Performance Management  Audit  Influencing  leadership  Leadership and Management  Leadership Development  Human Resources  Human Learning business leadership-and-management;0

Successful Interviewing;University of Maryland, College Park;Advanced;The goal of hiring managers is not just to hire people who need a job. Itï¿½s to hire people who believe in their organization, its mission and the work thatï¿½s involved in the job position. Every hiring manager knows: Hire people to do a job and theyï¿½ll work for your money. Hire people who believe in the work and theyï¿½ll work for their passion.  And this is not a case of ï¿½fake it until you make it.ï¿½ You have to be genuine about your belief in an organization and its mission. That means you have to have researched the industry, the company, and the position ï¿½ and be able to show how your goals in life align with the companyï¿½s mission. Having done so will shape the impression you convey as a candidate, the way you answer traditional questions, and the way you demonstrate that youï¿½re the right candidate for the job.  This course is the second in a five-course specialization. We recommend that courses , 1, , 2 and , 3 be taken in sequence. Course , 4 - on resume and cover letter writing - can be taken in any sequence, while course , 5 is the capstone for the specialization as a whole.  This course can be thought of as Interviewing I, while course , 3 is Interviewing II.  Course , 3 covers more Advanced interview formats, including behavioral and situational interviews - along with the special case of telephone screenings.  The logic for including telephone screenings - which happen at the start of the interview process - late in this specialization on interviewing is that those screenings, while happening early in the process, involve all the skills that you'll learn from course , 1 through course , 3.  As for this course, it will teach you how to:  1.\tDo thorough research on a company of your choice.  2.     Prepare for those critical first 3-5 minutes of an interview (when many recruiters say an interview is either won or lost).  3.     Prepare for the all important Tell Me About Yourself question.  4.     Prepare for traditional interview questions.  5.     Use strategies for handling the salary question.  We don't teach you salary negotiation techniques, but we do teach you  how to avoid putting yourself in a weak negotiation position.  6.\tPrepare an elevator speech - all three variations.  7.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to present professional accomplishments and qualifications in a manner that conveys benefits to a potential employer.  8.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to convince a potential employer of your interest, motivation and preparation for a particular position.  9.\tAdapt your nonverbal communication style to the expectations of English-speaking interviewers.;Strategy  canned response  show me!  interview  career  technology strategy  experience  english language  speech  self-assessment language-learning learning-english;1
Infonomics I: Business Information Economics and Data Monetization;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Intermediate;Thriving in the Information Age compels organizations to deploy information as an actual business asset, not as an IT asset or merely as a business byproduct. This demands creativity in conceiving and implementing new ways to generate economic benefits from the wide array of information assets available to an organization. Unfortunately, information too frequently is underappreciated and therefore underutilized.     This first course in the two-part Infonomics series provides a non-technical perspective on and methods for understanding and taking advantage of informationï¿½s unique economic characteristics. Starting with dissecting whether the information is or isnï¿½t an asset or even property, students will begin to appreciate the challenges and opportunities with treating it as one. Then the course examines how information behaves in the context of various familiar micro-economic concepts, and what can be gleaned from this to improve the way information is managed and leveraged. This leads to exploring the various ways information can generate economic benefitsï¿½or be monetized, including how various styles of business analytics can increase informationï¿½s potential and realized value for organizations.;Product Management  infonomics  information theory  analytics  Big Data  Business Intelligence  asset management  intangible asset  asset  monetization business business-essentials;2

Create a Python Application using PyMongo and MongoDB Database;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;Data plays a crucial role in application development. It plays such a crucial role that there are people called Database Administrators that specialize in just organizing the data. The traditional database used to be, and often still is, a relational database. MongoDB is more flexible than a relational database, and as such provides the developer with a database that can easily be changed during the development phase. The increased popularity of MongoDB combined with the popularity of Python has resulted in a Python library called PyMongo, which provides an API for communicating with MongoDB.  In this course, you will create a Python application, using PyMongo, that creates a MongoDB database containing words and their definitions. You will then retrieve data from the collection and display a selected Wordï¿½s definition.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

The Technology of Music Production;Berklee College of Music;Intermediate;Learn about the music production processï¿½including recording, editing, and mixingï¿½and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.  With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.      Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing.   We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.       Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide.   After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boardï¿½a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.      In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.;Audio Production  sound  guitar  electronic music  electronics  music  Audio Editing  microphone  Sound Design  ableton arts-and-humanities music-and-art;2

Making Successful Decisions through the Strategy, Law & Ethics Model;University of Michigan;Advanced;Successful decision making is based on three key pillars:  strategy, law and ethics.  After taking this course you will be able to use a practical framework based on these three elements to make successful business, personal and leadership decisions.    This course opens with an example of a leadership decision:  President Barack Obamaï¿½s strategic decision to capture or kill Osama bin Laden.  The course then shows how the three elements can be used to prevent a tragedy when making a personal decision.    The rest of the course focuses on making successful business decisions. ï¿½In essence, to achieve business and career success, you must create value (strategy) and manage risk (law) in a responsible manner (ethics).   Because the Law Pillar plays a central role in the three pillar model, the course includes practical legal briefings (with many examples) on the key elements of business success.  Specifically, the course shows you how to:   ï¿½\tattract the best employees,  ï¿½\tdevelop successful products,  ï¿½\tcreate new business models,  ï¿½\tprotect intellectual property,  ï¿½\tcreate contracts that achieve business goals, and  ï¿½\tuse dispute resolution processes that improve business relationships.

Challenging Forensic Science: How Science Should Speak to Court;University of Lausanne;Beginner;The aim of this course is to promote critical thinking with regard to forensic science. Today, in general, most people are dazzled by the technical possibilities offered by forensic science. They somewhat live in the illusion that forensic evidence is fool proof and brings factual findings with 100% certainty. This course ï¿½ given by specialists in the field ï¿½ goes beyond the conventional image that is promoted through TV series such as CSI. It alerts (without alarming) the public on the limits of the techniques in order to promote a sound administration of forensic science in the criminal justice system.ï¿½ It allows participants to understand the importance of probabilistic reasoning in forensic science, because uncertainty is a constitutive part of forensic science. The course is constructed as a series of causes cï¿½lï¿½bres that could or have led to miscarriages of justice. Some of these cases have been part of case reviews carried out at the School of Criminal Justice of the University of Lausanne.;crime  fingerprints  proposition  dna profiling  law  forensics  dnas  speech  forensic science  crime scene social-sciences law;0

Introduction to Statistics & Data Analysis in Public Health;Imperial College London;Advanced;Welcome to Introduction to Statistics & Data Analysis in Public Health!  This course will teach you the core building blocks of statistical analysis - types of variables, common distributions, hypothesis testing - but, more than that, it will enable you to take a data set you've never seen before, describe its keys features, get to know its strengths and quirks, run some vital basic analyses and then formulate and test hypotheses based on means and proportions. You'll then have a solid grounding to move on to more sophisticated analysis and take the other courses in the series. You'll learn the popular, flexible and completely free software R, used by statistics and machine learning practitioners everywhere. It's hands-on, so you'll first learn about how to phrase a testable hypothesis via examples of medical research as reported by the media. Then you'll work through a data set on fruit and vegetable eating habits: data that are realistically messy, because that's what public health data sets are like in reality. There will be mini-quizzes with feedback along the way to check your understanding. The course will sharpen your ability to think critically and not take things for granted: in this age of uncontrolled algorithms and fake news, these skills are more important than ever.  Prerequisites  Some formulae are given to aid understanding, but this is not one of those courses where you need a mathematics degree to follow it. You will need only basic numeracy (for example, we will not use calculus) and familiarity with graphical and tabular ways of presenting results.

Population Health: Governance;Universiteit Leiden;Advanced;How can we organise care in such a way that we optimize experience, quality and costs? What type of governance is needed? And how should healthcare organisations collaborate?  These are central questions in this course. In answering them, we depart from a recognition of the impact of three crucial global shifts in health care governance: 1) the change in focus from cure to population health, 2) the increased attention to social determinants of health,  and 3) the stronger involvement of non-governmental healthcare organisations in service delivery networks.   The course is unique in combining the Population Health perspective with theories of healthcare system governance. It takes a ï¿½multi-levelï¿½ perspective: the participant will look at healthcare governance from different angles in  the healthcare system as a whole: from the global and national level, to networks of organisations, to individual care organisations, and finally to the healthcare professional. All these actors should function well to optimize accessible, affordable and high quality of care. To attain these goals, specific managerial network and leadership skills are required.;coping with  behavior  Network Analysis  organizational structure  social network analysis  performance  partnership  Culture  Strategy  health care business leadership-and-management;1

Community Change in Public Health;Johns Hopkins University;Intermediate;In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the publicï¿½s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ï¿½communityï¿½ and the processes by which we ï¿½diagnoseï¿½ or seek to understand the structure and characteristics of different types of communities.  An appreciation of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention.  We examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution, deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.;efficacy  case study  u.s. securities and exchange commission  modeling  ecosystem model  community change  public health  economy  competence (human resources)  soil ecology life-sciences public-health;2

Introduction to Galois Theory;National Research University Higher School of Economics;Advanced;A very beautiful classical theory on field extensions of a certain type (Galois extensions) initiated by Galois in the 19th century. Explains, in particular, why it is not possible to solve an equation of degree 5 or more in the same way as we solve quadratic or cubic equations. You will learn to compute Galois groups and (before that) study the properties of various field extensions.  We first shall survey the basic notions and properties of field extensions: algebraic, transcendental, finite field extensions, degree of an extension,  algebraic closure, decomposition field of a polynomial.  Then we shall do a bit of commutative algebra (finite algebras over a field, base change via tensor product) and apply this  to study the notion of separability in some detail.  After that we shall discuss Galois extensions and Galois correspondence and give many examples (cyclotomic extensions, finite fields, Kummer extensions, Artin-Schreier extensions, etc.).  We shall address the question of solvability of equations by radicals (Abel theorem). We shall also try to explain the relation to representations and to topological  coverings.  Finally, we shall briefly discuss  extensions of rings (integral elemets, norms, traces, etc.) and explain how to use the reduction modulo primes to compute Galois groups.  PREREQUISITES  A first course in general algebra ï¿½ groups, rings, fields, modules, ideals. Some knowledge of commutative algebra (prime and maximal ideals ï¿½ first few pages of any book in commutative algebra) is welcome. For exercises we also shall need some elementary facts about groups and their actions on sets, groups of permutations and, marginally,  the statement of Sylow's theorems.  ASSESSMENTS A weekly test and two more serious exams in the middle and in the end of the course. For the final result, tests count approximately 30%, first (shorter) exam 30%, final exam 40%.

Intellectual Humility: Practice;The University of Edinburgh;Beginner;We live in a polarised world where all too often people talk past each other. But do you know when to believe what others say? For example, how quick should we be to accept something that someone else tells us is true, and what should we be looking out for when assessing a person's trustworthiness? Meanwhile, what should we do when we encounter disagreements with people who seem to be our equals? How and when should we adjust our beliefs, and how does the appropriate response vary depending on the evidence? These challenges may be especially important in the arena of religious disagreements. How should we weigh the evidence for and against various theistic and atheistic stances?  Experts in psychology, philosophy, theology and education are conducting exciting new research on these questions, and the results have important, real-world applications. Faced with difficult questions people often tend to dismiss and marginalize dissent. Political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing, and sometimes even dangerous. And whether itï¿½s Christian fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, or militant atheism, religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance, dogma, and ignorance. The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.  In this course. we will examine the following major questions about applied issues surrounding intellectual humility:   ï¿½         Should you believe what people say? ï¿½         How should we handle disagreement? ï¿½         What is the role of evidence in resolving religious disagreements?   All lectures are delivered by leading specialists, and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life.   This course can be taken as a part of a series which explores the theory, the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility. Before, we considered how to define and measure intellectual humility, what intellectual virtue is, whether we are born or can become humble, and what cognition and emotions can tell us about intellectual humility.

Homeland Security & Cybersecurity Connection - It's Not About the Terrorists;University of Colorado System;Intermediate;Welcome to Course 1 in CS4950, Homeland Security and Cybersecruity. In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its connection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and man-made. For most of history the man-made variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their surpassing disproportion. The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.  Best wishes and good luck!

Social Network Analysis;University of California, Davis;Beginner;This course is designed to quite literally ï¿½make a scienceï¿½ out of something at the heart of society: social networks. Humans are natural network scientists, as we compute new network configurations all the time, almost unaware, when thinking about friends and family (which are particular forms of social networks), about colleagues and organizational relations (other, overlapping network structures), and about how to navigate delicate or opportunistic network configurations to save guard or advance in our social standing (with society being one big social network itself). While such network structures always existed, computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically. In the first part of the course we focus on network structure. This looks as static snapshots of networks, which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems. In our hands-on lab, you will also visualize and analyze a network with a software yourself, which will help to appreciate the complexity social networks can take on. During the second part of the course, we will look at how networks evolve in time. We ask how we can predict what kind of network will form and if and how we could influence network dynamics.;Factorial  s-box  network science  analysis  social network analysis  Databases  social network  computational social science  Mathematics  Network Analysis data-science data-analysis;0

Public Economics;National Research University Higher School of Economics;Advanced;This course offers an introduction into the public economics theory. It does not aspire to cover theories of taxation, public expenditures, regulation etc. at length and in-depth. Rather, our ambition is to give a bird's-eye view of central themes of public economics and related disciplines, and teach concepts, logic, and ideas, rather than methods of analysis, which would require an entirely different course format.  Our choice of topics covered by the course reflects a trade-off between salience and centrality, on the one hand, and suitability for a brief online introductory course, on the other. The course content is neither comprehensive (which would be a mission impossible for virtually any public economics course), nor representative of other such courses. With these limitations and caveats in mind, we encourage our students to continue their public economics studies in a more regular fashion, and see our role inter alia in motivating interest in such continued education.  The central theme of the course is the role of government as a mechanism of resource allocation which complements and augments markets. Governments are viewed as public agencies set to correct market failures. Such agencies however are prone to failures of their own, and hence markets and governments are two imperfect alternatives. We deal with government's limitations, with particular emphasis on those that have to do with informational asymmetry, limited administrative capacity, and imperfect accountability to society. Otherwise the course's man themes are economics of taxation, regulation, politics of public economics, incentives in government, and government vis-ï¿½-vis (civil) society.

Logistic Regression with Python and Numpy;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;In this 2-hour long project-based course, you will learn how to implement Logistic Regression using Python and Numpy. Logistic Regression is an important fundamental concept if you want break into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Even though popular machine learning frameworks have implementations of logistic regression available, it's still a great idea to learn to implement it on your own to understand the mechanics of optimization algorithm, and the training and validation process.  Since this is a practical, project-based course, you will need to have a theoretical understanding of logistic regression, and gradient descent. We will focus on the practical aspect of implementing logistic regression with gradient descent, but not on the theoretical aspect.  By the end of this course, you would create and train a logistic model that will be able to predict if a given image is of hand-written digit zero or of hand-written digit one. The model will be able to distinguish between images or 0s and 1s, and it will do that with a very high accuracy. Not only that, your implementation of the logistic model will also be able to solve any generic binary classi?cation problem. You will still have to train model instances on speci?c datasets of course, but you wonï¿½t have to change the implementation and it will be re-usable. The dataset for images of hand written digits comes from the popular MNIST dataset. This data set consists of images for the 10 hand-written digits (from 0 to 9), but since we are implementing logistic regression, and are looking to solve binary classi?cation problems - we will work with examples of hand written zeros, and hand written ones and we will ignore examples of rest of the digits.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Then, we build on product ciphers (using both substitution and transposition/permutation) to describe modern block ciphers and review the widely used cipher algorithms in DES, 3-DES, and AES. Lastly, we enable the use of block ciphers to support variable data length by introducing different modes of block cipher operations in ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR modes.  This course is cross-listed and is a part of the two specializations, the Applied Cryptography specialization and the Introduction to Applied Cryptography specialization.;ruby on rails  cipher  symmetric-key algorithm  stream cipher  Cryptography  Permutations  feistel cipher  meet-in-the-middle attack  block cipher  Algorithms computer-science computer-security-and-networks;1
Build a Guessing Game Application using Java;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;In this project you will create a guessing game application that pits the computer against the user. You will create variables, static methods, decision constructs, and loops in Java to create the game.  Learning Java gives the programmer a wide variety of career paths to choose from. Java was once the property of Sun Microsystems but is now an open-source (free) programming language that is used in web programming, mobile applications, and many desktop applications. Java is a natural choice for object-oriented programming as it contains many existing classes for the programmer to use from its feature-rich API. In addition, Java is truly cross-platform, which means it can be compiled on a Windows system and executed on a Mac or Linux system. Java contains a built-in garbage collector that removes objects no longer needed in the application which reduces memory leak issues.

Command Line in Linux;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;Linux is a popular operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It has many distributions which have different interfaces for installing software, different user interfaces, and so on. One thing all of the ï¿½distrosï¿½ have in common is that they all have a command line interface, or terminal. In fact, sometimes there is no user interface except the terminal itself. A Linux server running a web application on AWS, for example, may only contain the software required to run the application, and no GUI ï¿½windowï¿½ system at all. It is crucial to learn the Linux command line if you are going to be a productive Linux user and/or administer a Linux server.  In this course, you will use Linux commands to navigate Linux directories, search for files, search for patterns, create files and directories, and remove files and directories.

Generative Design for Performance and Weight Reduction;Autodesk;Intermediate;There are many considerations and factors that play a part in designing a new product. Cost is usually a big one, but sometimes there are other factors that are the main contributors to a product's direction. With vehicles, specifically motorcycles, we see Advanced engineering practices performed on seemingly minor parts. In some instances, making a part as light as possible can have a big effect on performance. In other cases, the strength or stiffness of a part, such as a motor mount, is more critical than its mass. Generative design allows us the ability to solve for both problems at the same time and make informed design decisions without the sacrifice. In this course, weï¿½ll explore how generative design can be applied to motorcycle parts to help reduce mass while also increasing performance.

A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment;Indian School of Business;Advanced;What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?  This is surely one of lifeï¿½s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.  How valid are our theories?  Until recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.

Intellectual Humility: Science;The University of Edinburgh;Intermediate;Itï¿½s clear that the world needs more intellectual humility. But how do we develop this virtue? And why do so many people still end up so arrogant? Do our own biases hold us back from becoming as intellectually humble as we could beï¿½and are there some biases that actually make us more likely to be humble? Which cognitive dispositions and personality traits give people an edge at being more intellectually humble - and are they stable from birth, learned habits, or something in between? And what can contemporary research on the emotions tell us about encouraging intellectual humility in ourselves and others?  Experts in psychology, philosophy and education are conducting exciting new research on these questions, and the results have important, real-world applications. Faced with difficult questions people often tend to dismiss and marginalize dissent. Political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing, and sometimes even dangerous. And whether itï¿½s Christian fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, or militant atheism, religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance, dogma, and ignorance. The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.   In this course, we will examine the following major questions about the science of intellectual humility: ï¿½ How do we become intellectually humble? ï¿½ What can human cognition tell us about intellectual humility? ï¿½ How does arrogance develop, and how can we become more open-minded? ï¿½ How do emotions affect our ability to be intellectually humble?    All lectures are delivered by leading specialists, and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life.   This course can be taken as a part of a series which explores the theory, the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility. In the previous course on the theory behind intellectual humility, we considered how to define intellectual humility, the nature of an intellectual virtue, and how we know who is intellectually humble.

Design and Interpretation of Clinical Trials;Johns Hopkins University;Beginner;Clinical trials are experiments designed to evaluate new interventions to prevent or treat disease in humans. The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g., hearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions). We consider clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather than the patients or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive. Results from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of treatments are objective and unbiased. The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US. The course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several common designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over designs. We will also explain some of the mechanics of clinical trials, like randomization and blinding of treatment. In the second half of the course, we will explain how clinical trials are analyzed and interpreted. Finally, we will review the essential ethical consideration involved in conducting experiments on people.;randomization  clinical trials  research ethics  Clinical Trial Design  Trial Design  analysis  interpretation  clinical research  Clinical Trial  ethics life-sciences research;0

Soul Beliefs: Causes and Consequences - Unit 2: Belief Systems;Rutgers the State University of New Jersey;Advanced;Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have, however defined, a ï¿½soul.ï¿½ While the question of whether the soul exists cannot be answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.  The course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into 3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences.  These videos include slides and some embedded video clips.  Most lectures are accompanied by slides used during the lecture, also including recommended reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities to reflect on your studies.

Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression;The University of Melbourne;Beginner;While the human genome sequence has transformed our understanding of human biology, it isnï¿½t just the sequence of your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.    Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.  This course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.  All necessary information will be covered in the lectures, and recommended and required readings will be provided. There are no additional required texts for this course. For those interested, additional information can be obtained in the following textbook.  Epigenetics. Allis, Jenuwein, Reinberg and Caparros. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press.

For example, in a list of data with yearly rainfall amounts, to quickly determine the years with the most rainfall, the data can be sorted according to rainfall in descending order. A filter could be used to limit the amount of data observed, for example, to only show rainfall amounts greater than an inch. A merge can be used to join two datasets together, for example rainfall and temperature data from two different sources. The ability to sort, merge and filter data has always existed using SQL with database data, now it can be done in application memory space using Python.  In this course, you will create an application that reads data from two CSV files. You will learn how to merge, sort, and filter the data to ultimately produce a regression plot to determine a possible correlation between two data sets.;merge sort  Pandas  jpeg  Regression  sorting  inequality (mathematics)  Algebra  Correlation And Dependence  Mergers & Acquisitions  Python Programming data-science data-analysis;0

Deciphering Secrets: The Illuminated Manuscripts of Medieval Europe;University of Colorado System;Beginner;Perhaps no other relic of the European Middle Ages captures our imagination more than illuminated medieval manuscripts, or those documents decorated with images and colored pigments. Serving as windows unto a lost world of kings, ladies, faith, war, and culture, they communicate complex visual and textual narratives of Europeï¿½s collective cultural heritage and patrimony. In this fashion, illuminated manuscripts are dynamic messages from our communal past that are still relevant today in fields like graphic design and typography.  In this seven-week course, students will explore the material creation, content, and historical context of illuminated medieval European manuscripts. Students will acquire an introductory knowledge of their distinguishing characteristics, their cataloguing and periodization (when they were created), the methods utilized to produce them, and their historical context and value.  Student achievement will be assessed using not only traditional multiple-choice quizzes, but more importantly will be evaluated based on individual student projects. In their final projects students will either (1) produce a board of commented images about medieval manuscripts or (2) prepare a physical manuscript using medieval methods. The best of these peer-evaluated projects will be posted on the Deciphering Secrets website, which is our collective citizen scholarship web presence that encourages and supports our global citizen scholars appreciation and contributions to transcription of medieval manuscripts.  Finally, we wish to highlight that this course is an exciting international collaboration between the University of Colorado (USA) and Universidad Complutense Madrid (Spain).;page layout  decipherment  history of the book  process  middle age  primary source  Art History  inquiry  Page Design  history arts-and-humanities history;0

Successful Presentation;University of Colorado Boulder;Intermediate;Few kinds of communication can have the effect of a powerful presentation.  Even a short speech can motivate people to change long-held beliefs or to take action, and a wonderfully delivered speech can transform a normal person into a leader.  In this course, Prof. William Kuskin provides a series of pragmatic videos and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations. The course develops through four themesï¿½mastering fear, developing a creative formula, using verbal and body language, and anticipating the roomï¿½so that you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.    Successful presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters.  They depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore, is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express it to the world.  After this course, with some practice, you will be able to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like.;Creativity  presentation  Writing  Communication  self-confidence  Business Writing  Business Presentations  speech  public speaking  confidence business business-essentials;2

Genius. Talent. Golden Mediocrity;National Research Tomsk State University;Beginner;This course is of an applied nature and is oriented to studies in the field of creative life intensification psychology, help with the experience of crises, human potential realization and care. It may be useful for professional psychologists, for specialists whose activity involves empathy, inspiration, understanding and creating of daily life, and for all who are interested in the topic.   The main idea of the course Genius, talent and golden mediocrity are different (perpendicularly oriented) dimensions of human existence. They should be studied coherently with their manifestations. All together they construct a space for creative life, but each taken separately provokes traumatic, devastating and exhausting forms of anxieties. Our course shows how these three dimensions manifest themselves in life and how you can fulfill your genius, abilities, talents more fully and completely.  Our Method We critically examine the manifestations of the studied dimensions (phenomena), in order that by putting off all the supposed we could find specific and inherent meaning. The phenomenological method is to understand and express in simple terms the fundamental structure of creative activity, to express everything that was, that is and that will be important in the psychology of creative life.  Course objective Our main objective is a phenomenological description of genius, talent and golden mediocrity as specific dimensions of human life, correction of errors and misapprehensions of common sense regarding these phenomena.  What you gain After taking this course you will know what it is to be genius. You will see the phenomena of mediocrity and talent in a new light. You will understand these phenomena better based on our various examples. You will also be able to practice various aspects of these dimensions of creativity in your daily life.;experience  confidence  doubt  health  psychotherapy  phenomenology  palaces  opinion  thought  sustainability life-sciences psychology;0

Cybersecurity and Mobility;University System of Georgia;Beginner;This course is for you if you are interested in transitioning toward a managerial role in cybersecurity and mobility. Through interviews with industry experts in this area, you will be able to analyze innovations powering the rapid spread of information technology and how they present new challenges for protecting data. For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. After this course, you will be able to describe how the nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.  If you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.  After completing the course modules you will be able to explain how yesterdayï¿½s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping Advanced, targeted attacks. Effective cybersecurity must be multi-dimensional and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere, target numerous levels of an organization, and sometimes persist for months or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach. Therefore securing networks requires a holistic approach that incorporates several elements.;security  global workforce  internet of things  smartphones  wireless lan  internet  global  openfabrics alliance  sap erp  Mobile Security computer-science computer-security-and-networks;0
After the Arab Spring ï¿½ Democratic Aspirations and State Failure;University of Copenhagen;Beginner;Learn why the hope and excitement of the Arab Spring is gone, why so many Arab states are falling apart, why the youth are so frustrated, why there are so many refugees, and what can be done about it.  The so-called Arab Spring appeared to end decades of exceptionalism and bring the Arab world back into the mainstream of global developments. The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.  Today, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?  This course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead ï¿½has given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.ï¿½ This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special. Does this condition make this part of the world impervious to generally observable trends towards greater accountability, popular participation in political decision-making, greater generation and fairer division of economic wealth?

The Fundamentals of Computing Capstone Exam;Rice University;Advanced;While most specializations on Coursera conclude with a project-based course, students in the Fundamentals of Computing specialization have completed more than 20+ projects during the first six courses of the specialization. Given that much of the material in these courses is reused from session to session, our goal in this capstone class is to provide a conclusion to the specialization that allows each student an opportunity to demonstrate their individual mastery of the material in the specialization.  With this objective in mind, the focus in this Capstone class will be an exam whose questions are updated periodically. This approach is designed to help insure that each student is solving the exam problems on his/her own without outside help. For students that have done their own work, we do not anticipate that the exam will be particularly hard. However, those students who have relied too heavily on outside help in previous classes may have a difficult time. We believe that this approach will increase the value of the Certificate for this specialization.;display devices  algorithm design  c programming  approximation error  Computer Programming  Computer Science  Theoretical Computer Science  .properties  Python Programming  Trigonometric Integral computer-science software-development;1

Understanding Russians: Contexts of Intercultural Communication;National Research University Higher School of Economics;Advanced;In the course ï¿½Understanding Russians: Contexts of Intercultural Communications: we will:  1)\tBuild skills in the analysis of the intercultural communication process using Russian-Western communication as an example.   2)\tApply the knowledge of interrelations between different contexts of communication (cultural, institutional, professional, social, interpersonal, etc.) to the cultural history and national psychology of Russians.  The purpose of the course is to provide the students with a broad overview of the basic principles governing the past, the present and the future interactions between Russia and the West, with a focus on the culture and national psychology of Russians and Western Europeans.  For example, we will look at the cases when basic cultural values of Russians show up through the linguistic choices shaping language production which is consequently misattributed by Western partners. No matter what the language of intercultural communication is ï¿½ Russian, or English ï¿½ the meaning of many linguistic expressions may be reconstructed wrongly by the representatives of another culture.  Some of the basic questions we will tackle are:  ï¿½\tWhat are the concepts of culture that have the strongest influence on communication? ï¿½\tWhat are Russian basic cultural values and how they shape modern Russian consciousness? ï¿½\tWhat are the specific communication patterns of modern Russians, including those of public and electronic discourse? ï¿½\tWhat is important to know about communication with Russians in organizational contexts?  Importantly, this course is NOT just a list of practical instructions of dos and donï¿½ts of dealing with Russians. The course contains a substantial academic component introducing the key notions and concepts of the Theory of Communication, which will be extensively introduced throughout the first few modules of the course. These theoretical grounds will be further on used as a tool for analyzing the intercultural communications with Russians.  Do you have technical problems?

Coexistence in Medieval Spain: Jews, Christians, and Muslims;University of Colorado System;Beginner;This course explores Jewish, Christian, and Muslim intercultural relations in Iberia from the Visigothic era (6th century CE) until the creation of Queen Isabel I and King Ferdinand II Catholic Spain (late 15th century). We evaluate the many identities of the peninsula known as Christian Hispania, Jewish Sefarad, and Islamic al-Andalus. We trace the origins and trajectory of conflict between these communities (the Muslim conquest of Spain, Christian Reconquista, prohibitions blocking intermixing of peoples, and expulsions). We aim to understand conflicts within communities as well, such as the tensions between Christian Arian Visigoths and native Catholic Iberians or the fundamentalist North African Almohad Dynasty that rejected the Spanish Umayyad Caliphateï¿½s preference for religious tolerance. We delve into an appreciation of collaboration and coexistence among these communities. We explore the unique role of the Jewish community who Muslims and Christians depended upon as political and cultural intermediaries as well as their intellectual collaborators. We find the history of how peoples attempted to create and manage viable diverse communities. As we study this history, the Honors Track will employ an investigative process (ï¿½The Historianï¿½s Craftï¿½) that involves viewing, reading, analyzing, and reflecting on events, peoples, places, and artifacts.;curiosity  history  middle east  golden age  linguistics  composite artifact colors  Poetry Writing  skepticism  conquesting  Culture arts-and-humanities history;0

Genome Assembly Programming Challenge;University of California San Diego;Intermediate;In Spring 2011, thousands of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and often led to kidney failure. It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lï¿½beck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice ï¿½ computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.  To investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They even used GitHub for the project: https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki  The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.;Computer Programming  outbreak  k-mer  dna sequencing  Data Structures  computational biology  assembly (programming)  graphs  genomics  Algorithms computer-science algorithms;2

Global Impact: Cultural Psychology;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Intermediate;Globalization has brought dramatic changes to the marketplace. A proliferation of global brands brings diverse cultures to a consumer population that is also growing culturally diverse. This course enables students to understand how globalization changes consumers at a psychological level, and provides tools for imbuing brands with cultural meaningsï¿½creating iconic brandsï¿½that can resonate with global consumers. The focus is on understanding that culture exists in the mind (e.g., values and beliefs) as well as in the environment (e.g., objects, brands, and institutions), and that globalization creates multi-cultural spaces in contemporary societies. Consumers can use the cultural meaning of a brand to build their identities (i.e., assimilate the brand cultural symbolism) or reject the brandï¿½s cultural meaning(s) (i.e., exclusionary reactions).  The course will help students identify when assimilation vs. exclusionary reactions are more likely to occur, as well as devise strategies for imbuing brands with cultural meanings that can elevate them to the status of cultural icons.   Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: ï¿½\tUnderstand how globalization impacts the psychological responses of consumers in global markets  ï¿½\tUnderstand what culture is and how it manifests itself  ï¿½\tUnderstand how brands acquire cultural meanings  ï¿½\tPredict consumersï¿½ responses to the cultural meanings in brands  ï¿½\tIdentify strategies to win-over multi-cultural consumers in globalized markets  ï¿½\tLearn how to build an iconic brand  This course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Sustainable Tourism ï¿½ promoting environmental public health;University of Copenhagen;Beginner;The MOOC introduces learners to key environmental health and natural resources management challenges associated with the rapid growth in international tourist arrivals into low-income countries. Since infrastructural and regulatory capacities in such countries are often limited they are more exposed to the negative implications of such development. The MOOC will present experiences and potential avenues to develop a more sustainable form of tourism.  The Course particularly focuses on the problems and potentials of tourism development in small island states in tropical and sub-tropical settings and highlights the challenges of such development on vulnerable ecosystems. It also highlights how tourism development in Zanzibar results in increased pressure on its marine environment, solid waste management, water resources and control of mosquitoes.  These factors will be used as tracers of impacts and areas for future improvement towards a more sustainable form of tourism.  The Course topics also relate to a number of targets under the global Sustainable Development Goals connected especially to Goals 3: ï¿½good health and well-beingï¿½, 6: ï¿½clean water and sanitationï¿½, 14: ï¿½life below waterï¿½ and 17: ï¿½partnershipsï¿½.  Thus, the Course is a continuation of the efforts and discussions raised as part of the 2017 international year of sustainable tourism.   A diversity of perspectives and areas of expertise will be presented by researchers from the University of Copenhagen, State University of Zanzibar, representatives from the hotel sector and international experts in specific areas of sustainable tourism.;insecticide  public health  marine ecosystem  Leadership and Management  coral reef  sustainability  environmental health  hotel  sustainable tourism  Solid Waste Management life-sciences basic-science;0
Firm Level Economics: Markets and Allocations;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Beginner;In this class, we will derive equilibrium outcomes across a variety of market structures. We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution, and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts of this externality.  Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: ï¿½\tExplain how different market structures result in different resource allocations. ï¿½\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out. ï¿½\tEvaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of efficiency.   ï¿½\tExplain when and why the government might intervene with regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some markets. ï¿½\tDescribe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes. ï¿½\tUnderstand externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.  This course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Understanding China, 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach, Part 2;The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;Beginner;The purpose of this course is to summarize new directions in Chinese history and social science produced by the creation and analysis of big historical datasets based on newly opened Chinese archival holdings, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.  Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.  Part 1 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-1) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ï¿½Who rises to the top?ï¿½ and ï¿½Who gets what?ï¿½.   Part 2 (this course) turns to an arguably even more important question ï¿½Who are we?ï¿½ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction ï¿½ and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.

Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II);University of California San Diego;Advanced;You may have heard a lot about genome sequencing and its potential to usher in an era of personalized medicine, but what does it mean to sequence a genome?  Biologists still cannot read the nucleotides of an entire genome as you would read a book from beginning to end. However, they can read short pieces of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces. We will further learn about brute force algorithms and apply them to sequencing mini-proteins called antibiotics.   In the first half of the course, we will see that biologists cannot read the 3 billion nucleotides of a human genome as you would read a book from beginning to end.  However, they can read shorter fragments of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces in what amounts to the largest jigsaw puzzle ever put together.  In the second half of the course, we will discuss antibiotics, a topic of great relevance as antimicrobial-resistant bacteria like MRSA are on the rise.  You know antibiotics as drugs, but on the molecular level they are short mini-proteins that have been engineered by bacteria to kill their enemies.  Determining the sequence of amino acids making up one of these antibiotics is an important research problem, and one that is similar to that of sequencing a genome by assembling tiny fragments of DNA.  We will see how brute force algorithms that try every possible solution are able to identify naturally occurring antibiotics so that they can be synthesized in a lab.  Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to sequence the genome of a deadly Staphylococcus bacterium that has acquired antibiotics resistance.;Algorithms  antibiotics  Bioinformatics  acid  genomics  biochemistry  computational biology  biology  genome  antibiotic life-sciences health-informatics;1

Model Thinking;University of Michigan;Beginner;We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians.   The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in Advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!;six sigma  Behavioral Economics  Economics  logic  modeling  Critical Thinking  analysis  strategic thinking  systems thinking  thought social-sciences economics;0

Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;In this course youï¿½ll learn how to effectively retrieve data from a relational database table using the SQL language.   We all know that most computer systems rely on at least one database to store data. Your tax information is stored in the database used by the Internal Revenue Service. Your phone stores your contactsï¿½   names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers in a database. If you shop online, youï¿½re viewing photos, descriptions, and prices of products that are stored in a database. Database designers go to great lengths to design databases so that the data can be stored securely and in an organized format. Itï¿½s important to note that the main reason they go to all that work is so that we can get the data back out again when we need it! Thatï¿½s called ï¿½data retrievalï¿½.   Data is retrieved or read from a relational database by using a language called SQL to query (or question) the database. SQL is referred to as ï¿½the language of relational databasesï¿½. It can be used by itself or embedded in programs to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be displayed on a web page or PC application, or even printed on paper.   Youï¿½ll be practicing writing SQL queries using SQLiteStudio.   Next time you go online and look up the daily special at your favorite restaurant, you can think about the fact that itï¿½s likely that an SQL query was used behind the scenes to fetch that data and pop it up on your screen. By the end of this course, youï¿½ll even have a pretty good idea what the query might have looked like!  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. Weï¿½re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.;Data Analysis  select (sql)  database management systems  online shopping  table (database)  data retrieval  Databases  web page  numbers (spreadsheet)  SQL information-technology data-management;0
Global Strategy I: How The Global Economy Works;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Advanced;Starting in the late 1990s, ï¿½globalizationï¿½ became a buzzword to describe the apparent integration of markets in the world economy. Many authors and pundits claimed that the world was converging towards a market-friendly democratic place, while gurus and consulting firms were not short of formulae and advice on how to make profits out of the global economy. Decades later, new realities show that globalization does not mean political, cultural, and economic convergence and that forces against it are strong.  This course seeks to help you understand the forces of globalization and how cross-cultural management and the relationship of a multinational organization to various host countries is becoming more and more critical in todayï¿½s global economy. This course begins with the discussion of these issues and global relationships and delves into a deeper understanding of business strategy in todayï¿½s global business marketplace.  Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: ï¿½\tUnderstand how we got here and why it matters ï¿½\tUnderstand the complexities of the current globalization (not all countries are the same) ï¿½\tEvaluate the effects of international trade regulations on international business ï¿½\tEvaluate when and why should we operate as multinationals  This course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases;The Pennsylvania State University;Intermediate;Not so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high.    Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.  After weï¿½ve covered the basics, we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course weï¿½ll be talking about vaccination too. Weï¿½ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology. And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus.

Data Structures and Performance;University of California San Diego;Beginner;How do Java programs deal with vast quantities of data? Many of the data structures and algorithms that work with introductory toy examples break when applications process real, large data sets.  Efficiency is critical, but how do we achieve it, and how do we even measure it?  This is an intermediate Java course. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science, and in particular, we recommend that you have taken the first course in this specialization (which also requires some previous experience with Java).    In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.  You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.  The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage, manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data.  This is an intermediate Java course, and we will build on your prior knowledge.  This course is designed around  the same video series as in our first course in this specialization, including explanations of core content, learner videos, student and engineer testimonials, and support videos -- to better allow you to choose your own path through the course!;java (software platform)  Algorithms  Data Structures  hashing  trie  Computer Programming  binary tree  hash table  Java Programming  linked list computer-science algorithms;0

Science of Training Young Athletes Part 2;University of Florida;Intermediate;In this course you will learn how to design the type of training that takes advantage of the plastic nature of the athleteï¿½s body so you mold the right phenotype for a sport. We explore ways the muscular system can be designed to generate higher force and power and the type of training needed to mold the athlete's physical capacity so it meets the energy and biochemical demands of the sport.   We also examine the cost of plasticity when it is carried beyond the ability of the body to adjust itself to meet the imposed training stresses. The cost of overextending plasticity comes in the form injuries and chronic fatigue. In essence, a coach can push the athleteï¿½s body too far and it can fail. Upon completion of this course you will be able to assemble a scientifically sound annual training plan.;sports  Training  heart rate  performance  ordered pair  Planning  adaptation  exercise  homeostasis  coaching personal-development personal-development;2
Planning: Principled, Proposing, Proofing, and Practicing to a Success Plan;Michigan State University;Advanced;According to Steven Blank a business startup, or any new venture startup is essentially a proto-type. Thus the startup process essentially becomes a learning process to refine that business proto-type into a scalable, replicable finished 'product'.  At the end of this course learners will be able to:    -complete a business model summarizing assumptions about what value they will offer to whom, and how they will make      money.    - systematically test and validate these assumptions within the constraints of their available resources, and    - use these validated assumptions to generate financial projections that are based on actual resources and efforts expended.  The days of the 40 page business plan have certainly passed, but the role of planning in the business creation process is one of extreme importance. In this course we will explore the important components that you need to explore in detail prior to business creation. Action without planning is a recipe for disaster and we will make sure you have a rock solid foundation for future actions.  The planning here is focused on learning. It is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful when they (and often no one else) has any experience with the new venture and the conditions which it is likely to face. Thus the business plan based largely on assumptions and aggregate, non-applicable data is replaced with the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value the business will offer to whom, and how it will make money. The course will guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating these assumptions, and obtaining specific, applicable data. It will then show learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro-forma financial statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model.;Planning  time limit  proposition  franchising  Entrepreneurship  principle  business plan  value proposition  enabling  ordered pair business entrepreneurship;1

Understanding child development: from synapse to society;Utrecht University;Intermediate;In this course, we dive into the topic of child development. You will learn that child development is complex and is influenced by a surprisingly rich number of factors at many different levels of organization. You will see that development can be studied in various domains and at various levels of understanding, from different angles and disciplines. Importantly, you will come to understand that processes within and between the various domains and levels of organization continuously interact to shape development. This implies that understanding development requires taking an interdisciplinary approach.  In order to help you organize your thinking about this complexity you will learn more about the developmental systems approach and theories related to that. We will look, amongst other things, at the brain and motor development, cognitive, language and social-emotional development and all the factors that have an influence on development.  To illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach helps to understand child development you will see how researchers from various disciplines and backgrounds study child development at Utrecht University. These scientists will give a look in their field of knowledge and their collaboration with colleagues, to illustrate how the theory you will learn translates to practice.  In sum, we invite you to follow us on a journey to understand child development from synapse to society!;language development  child development  educational practices  pediatrics  developmental psychology  child  childhood  educational psychology  early childhood  Child Psychology social-sciences education;2
Ethical Leadership Through Giving Voice to Values;University of Virginia;Intermediate;This course offers an action-oriented introduction to Giving Voice to Values (or GVV), an exciting new approach to values-driven leadership development in the workplace, in business education and in life.   GVV is not about persuading people to be more ethical, but instead it starts from the premise that most of us already want to act on our values, but that we also want to feel that we have a reasonable chance of doing so effectively. Through positive, real life examples, pre-scripting, rehearsal and peer coaching, GVV builds the skill, the confidence and likelihood that we will act on our values more often and more successfully. Based on research and practice, with over 1;000 pilots in educational settings and companies on all seven continents, GVV helps answer the questions: ï¿½What if I were going to act on my values? What would I say and do? How could I be most effective?ï¿½  This course was developed at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia and is taught by top-ranked faculty. You will come away from GVV with an expanded toolkit, as well as practice, in a variety of methods and techniques for voicing and enacting your own values and principles. You will develop and practice leadership skills in peer coachingï¿½ with other learners. Through cases and stories based on recognizable workplace, classroom and life values conflicts, you will apply the GVV techniques and ï¿½re-framesï¿½, expanding your repertoire for possible action as well as identifying and rehearsing responses that are likely to be most effective. Through this practice, you will gain greater confidence and competence in voicing and enacting your values effectively.;2

Natural Attenuation of Groundwater Contaminants: New Paradigms, Technologies, and Applications;Rice University;Advanced;Cleaning up the large number of groundwater contamination sites is a significant and complex environmental challenge.  The environmental industry is continuously looking for remediation methods that are both effective and cost-efficient. Over the past 10 years there have been amazing, important developments in our understanding of key attenuation processes and technologies for evaluating natural attenuation processes, and a changing institutional perspective on when and where Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) may be applied.  Despite these advances, restoring groundwater contaminated by anthropogenic sources to allow for unrestricted use continues to be a challenge. Because of a complex mix of physical, chemical, and biological constraints associated with active in-situ cleanup technologies, there has been a long standing focus on understanding natural processes that attenuate groundwater contaminant plumes.  We will build upon basic environmental science and environmental engineering principles to discover how to best implement MNA as a viable treatment for groundwater contamination plumes.  Additionally we will delve into the history behind and make predictions about the new directions for this technology.    Any professional working in the environmental remediation industry will benefit from this in-depth study of MNA.  We will use lectures, readings, and computational exercises to enhance our understanding and implementation of MNA.  At the completion of this course, students will have updated understanding and practical tools that can be applied to all possible MNA sites.;bioremediation  process  Geology  Chemical Engineering  water supply  flow network  case study  f.lux  chemistry  groundwater remediation physical-science-and-engineering environmental-science-and-sustainability;1

Cybersecurity Policy for Aviation and Internet Infrastructures;University of Colorado System;Intermediate;In this course we will examine the aviation and Internet infrastructures, and various policies that have been developed to help guide and strengthen their cybersecurity programs.  The aviation and Internet infrastructures are also considered lifeline infrastructure as part of the transportation and communications sectors. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively.  The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector.  While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.  That is to say, they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards. This module will examine both the aviation and Internet lifeline infrastructure subsectors, and elements and application of the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA.;crime  Leadership and Management  process  adobe air  internet  security  Risk Management  airport security  relative change and difference  Risk social-sciences governance-and-society;2

CAM and Design Manufacturing for Mechanical Engineers with Autodesk Fusion 360;Autodesk;Beginner;With design for manufacturing, our design process focused on the design over its cost, but always keeping in mind how parts needed to be made. With manufacturing at the core of a design, we're able to fix potential problems in the design phase rather than after production. In many cases, the end product is made up of an assembly of different pieces to simplify manufacturing or to achieve specific design goals. Each piece represents a certain tolerance and put together, things might not work or fit if they werenï¿½t accounted for in the design.   We'll take a closer look at design and detail for manufacture and create toolpaths to cut parts. Even if the end goal as an engineer isnï¿½t to fabricate your own parts, itï¿½s a valuable skill to understand how things are made and what design decisions can ultimately affect how something is created.     After taking this course, you'll be able to:   - Inspect a multicomponent assembly. - Identify manufacturing methods based on part inspection. - Create detailed drawings for manufacturing. - Practice creating toolpaths for manufacture.;3d modeling  Mechanical Engineering  computer-aided design  manufacturing process management  Autodesk  Geometry  process  autocad  Mechanical Design  solidworks physical-science-and-engineering mechanical-engineering;0

Assessment for Learning;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Beginner;For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining and learning analytics systems in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by ï¿½big dataï¿½ including data persistency and student profiling.  -------------------------------- Recommended Background --------------------------------  This course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the learning society; including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part educative.  -------------------------------- Related Resources --------------------------------  Additional online resources are available here:  https://newlearningonline.com  -------------------------------- Take this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois --------------------------------  This course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the Learning Design and Leadership Program in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.

Tell the Data Story with Survey Graphics in Google Slides;Coursera Project Network;Advanced;ï¿½Tell me a story.ï¿½ At some point, we all have either heard those words or uttered them ourselves. The strong desire to be transported and to understand through narrative is something that stays with us through adulthood and is activated in our personal and professional lives. Why are humans so profoundly impacted by stories? Studies show that narrative helps us to find meaning in information and activates a desire to connect with it. By engaging with a story, we open the door to allow the meaning of it to resonate with us. For decision-making, this translates to narrative, the story, acting as the vehicle to make data actionable.  In this project, you will gain hands-on experience telling a simple data story that will connect with a professional audience. The story will be told with graphics created from survey data collected by a hypothetical company that hopes to grow their understanding of the customer experience and uncover where business opportunities may lie.

Text Retrieval and Search Engines;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Beginner;Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets. Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about peopleï¿½s opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text.   This course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines.;document retrieval  documents  language  web crawler  recommender systems  rankings  information retrieval  language model  Vector Spaces  text mining data-science data-analysis;0

With this course, recorded on campus at UCSD, we seek to share our access to top people in the field who bring an unprecedented range of expertise on drug commercialization.  This course will cover pharmacoeconomic, marketing strategy, intellectual property strategy, portfolio management, managed markets and strategic alliances. It will also have a lecture case study from startup to success.  In addition, the course will discuss post-marketing clinical trials or Phase 4 trials. These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environï¿½ment using a much larger group  of patients.  This enables new treatï¿½ment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .  Pre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall developï¿½ment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug. In addition to the marketing strategy, pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed. Promotional material, and the sales force will be trained so that when the product is approved they can promote the drug to physician, pharmacist and nurses.    This course is intended as part 3 of a series: Drug Discovery (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-discovery), Drug Development (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-development) and Drug Commercialization.  We would highly recommend that you take the courses in order since it will give you a better understanding on how a drug is discovered in the lab before being tested in clinical trials and then launched in the market place.;drug development  Marketing  pharmaceutical industry  drug discovery  biotechnology  drugs  clinical pharmacology  pharmaceutical marketing  intellectual property  commercialization life-sciences healthcare-management;0

Strategic Innovation: Building and Sustaining Innovative Organizations;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Advanced;Innovation strategy is about creating unique value for consumers by delivering a great product that satisfies their needs and capturing value back from consumers.  At the core of a successful innovation strategy is a great product concept. Product is an all-encompassing term that includes physical goods, intangible services, and even ideas. There are three pillars to a successful product strategy: a clear understanding of (a) the target customers (WHO), (b) the specific elements of the product offering (WHAT) that satisfies consumer needs and dovetails with company capabilities, and (c) the tactical plans to reach end consumers (HOW). The value proposition has to be embedded in a coherent business model in order to create and capture value. But well-laid innovation plans can go awry without a consideration of the business ecosystem that includes competitors, collaborators, including suppliers, distributors, and retailers, or the contextual environment in which the company operates. In an interdependent world, fostering an integrated ecosystem is critically important for companies interested in maximizing the odds of innovation success.  Drawing from many years of research, this course will offer a set of frameworks, tools, and concepts in order to develop innovative strategies in a holistic way so as to achieve leadership positions.;innovation management  Innovation  business model canvas  Business Strategy  marketing myopia  Strategy  modeling  value proposition  Leadership and Management  proposition business marketing;1

Relativism;University of California, Irvine;Intermediate;Relativism is an ancient philosophical doctrine which has recurred time and again in the history of philosophy. It has also transcended the boundaries of that discipline, for it has shaped much of the methodology in anthropology and sociology, as well as in critical theory and literary studies. While often advocated for its supposed tolerance of differences, relativism has profound consequences for how we think of reality, for the possibility of knowledge, both in the factual and in the moral domain, and may engender the practice of double standard.   If a wind is hot for me and cold for you and none of us is at fault, does this mean that reality is always perspectival, or that it admits of contradictory descriptions? If a belief turns out to be justified when evaluated within a certain epistemic system (such as religion, for instance), while it turns out to be unjustified if assessed from within a different one (science, say), does relativism undermine the very possibility of knowledge? If an action can be morally permissible within an ethical system and not so within a different one, does that challenge the idea that there are moral truths and moral progress? These are some of the questions we will engage in during the course, while considering examples taken from the history of science, such as the Bellarmine-Galileo dispute, and from everyday life.  This course is aimed at anyone who is interested in learning more about philosophy, along with those who are looking for strategies to combat extremism in their communities. Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life.  In this course, learners will:  Explore the concept of Relativism Discuss the role of Relativism in contemporary society Identify common responses to Relativism Compare/Contrast various forms of Relativism  Recognize how epistemic relativism can be used to explain important events in the history of science and crucial discoveries in anthropology Create a presentation with your personal perspective on one of the forms of relativism;Causality  denial  ethics  sociology  religion  relative change and difference  philosophy  Anthropology  skepticism  climate change skepticism and denial arts-and-humanities philosophy;2

System Validation (2): Model process behaviour;EIT Digital;Advanced;System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. It is the next logical step in computer science and improving software development in general. It allows automated analysis based on behavioural models of a system to see if a system works correctly. We want to guarantee that the systems does exactly what it is supposed to do. The techniques put forward in system validation allow to prove the absence of errors. It allows to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound and as a side effect enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful. This means that the systems are not only behaving correctly, but are also much easier to maintain and adapt. ï¿½Model process behaviour' is the follow up MOOC to 'Automata and behavioural equivalences'. This MOOC shows you how to model process behaviour, in particular protocols and distributed algorithms, dive deeper in the properties of system behaviour, and keep things simple to avoid a state space explosion.

How to Finance and Grow Your Startup ï¿½ Without VC;University of London;Advanced;Who?   If youï¿½re an entrepreneur at any stage of your journey, or even an aspiring one, and you need money to start or grow your business, this course is for you.   What?   This course will introduce, and help you put to use in your startup, the five models through which your customers can ï¿½ and will, if you ask them! ï¿½ fund your business. These five time-tested models have been put to use by entrepreneurial superstars like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and more. Sadly, though, the five models are rarely talked about and not widely understood. Until now! The five models will be brought to life by the real-world stories of an inspiring collection of incredibly creative entrepreneurs from around the world ï¿½ including successes and failures ï¿½ through a series of captivating no-holds-barred interviews with founders and others, and investors, too.   Why?   More than two generations ago, the venture capital community ï¿½ VCï¿½s, business angels, incubators, and others ï¿½ convinced the entrepreneurial world that writing business plans and raising venture capital constituted the twin centerpieces of entrepreneurial endeavor. They did so for very good reasons: the sometimes astonishing returns theyï¿½ve delivered to their investors and the incredibly large and valuable companies their ecosystem has created. But the vast majority of fast growing companies never take any angel or venture funding. Are they onto something that most of todayï¿½s entrepreneurial ecosystem has missed? Indeed, should a business angel or VC be seen as the first port of call for getting your nascent entrepreneurial venture off the ground or growing it faster? Perhaps not.   How?   Youï¿½ll be asked to do a series of exercises ï¿½ out in the real world ï¿½ to put your growing toolkit to use in your business or the one you hope to start. Hands-on, practical tools to help your business start and thrive ï¿½ without venture capital. Youï¿½ll join our discussion board of fellow participants, if you like, and learn from others who are putting the tools to work, just as you are.

Resilient Teaching Through Times of Crisis and Change;University of Michigan;Advanced;Resilient teaching is the ability to facilitate learning experiences that are designed to be adaptable to fluctuating conditions and disruptions. This teaching ability can be seen as an outcome of a design approach that attends to the relationship between learning goals and activities, and the environments they are situated in. Resilient teaching approaches take into account how a dynamic learning context may require new forms of interactions between teachers, students, content, and tools. Additionally, they necessitate the capacity to rethink the design of learning experiences based on a nuanced understanding of context.   The course is designed with higher education faculty, lecturers, and graduate student instructors in mind, but may also be applicable to educators in a wide variety of instructional environments. The course is aimed at participants who may be asked to rethink how they teach in the immediate or near future due to the ever-changing circumstances of the current COVID-19 pandemic. While the creation of this course is motivated by the current crisis, we expect it will remain relevant to instructors who are faced with disruptions and change to their teaching for any number of reasons and must quickly adapt their course designs.  To support learning and reflection, we are introducing a new journaling tool within the course that provides a place for participants to reflect on their own experiences. To support community growth, participants can choose to share their journal entries with the wider course community in an interactive gallery space.;crisis plan  cognitive behavioral therapy  law  crisis management  coaching  learning styles  Environmental Law  futures studies  psychology  future orientation social-sciences education;1
Reproducible Research;Johns Hopkins University;Beginner;This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.;rstudio  General Statistics  R Programming  language  Data Analysis  Writing  Computer Programming  markup language  Knitr  analysis data-science data-analysis;0

Future Healthcare Payment Models;Northeastern University;Intermediate;This course will review the drivers of healthcare cost and solutions that have been proposed to address cost, quality and value of health care. Many point blame for high costs on payment models that pay healthcare providers for every service they provide to patients, essentially paying more for volume and service intensity. This is called a Fee for Service (FFS) payment model. Some solutions, arguably the more sustainable solutions, are the combined strategies of new payment models, care management, insurance plan designs, consumer engagement tools, and technology.   Using that information we will explore various situations, showcasing coordinated care and payment strategies that can be implemented to improve patient health and the cost of delivery of healthcare services.  By the end of this course, the learner should be able to:   1. Identify the drivers and trends of healthcare spending from the perspective of various stakeholders, including medical providers, insurers, government and private purchasers and payments 2. Critically assess the impact of strategic and financial approaches that have been put in place by the ACA and the various modifications.  3. Evaluate how healthcare payment models currently work and the new direction that value-based payment is taking. 4.Identify how financial and non-financial metrics can be appropriately combined to improve a healthcare stakeholdersï¿½ value proposition.;Benefits  expanded access  engagement marketing  cost  health insurance  Payments  pricing  insurance  risk pool  Healthcare Delivery Systems life-sciences healthcare-management;2

Finding Mutations in DNA and Proteins (Bioinformatics VI);University of California San Diego;Advanced;In previous courses in the Specialization, we have discussed how to sequence and compare genomes. This course will cover Advanced topics in finding mutations lurking within DNA and proteins.  In the first half of the course, we would like to ask how an individual's genome differs from the reference genome of the species. Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and map them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient, requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.  In the second half of the course, we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.  This is the case, for example, in HIV studies, since the virus often mutates so quickly that researchers can struggle to study it.  The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.  Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools applying hidden Markov models to compare a protein against a related family of proteins.;Algorithms  reference genome  Hidden Markov Model  Bioinformatics  dynamic programming  sequence alignment  DNA  sequence alignment algorithms  Expectation Maximization Algorithm  pattern matching life-sciences health-informatics;1

Moving to the Cloud;The University of Melbourne;Beginner;The cloud is taking business by storm.  In fact, due to the extraordinary growth of the cloud, it has been described as a tornado, not a fluffy white floating object!  Commercial research analysts consider cloud as one of the most significant trends with a potential to change the whole global IT industry.  Governments, including those in the US, Britain, and Australia, have cloud-first policies now in place which mandate cloud over non-cloud services in ICT procurement.  But CIOs and other senior executives, while it's on the majority of their agendas, aren't sure what it really means for their organisations - how to leverage the benefits, control the commercials, manage the business risk, and adapt their organisations.    While it is important to set requirements, negotiate commercials (terms, service level agreements, and pricing), and sign the contract - it is also critical that we develop a clear plan for ï¿½Moving to the Cloudï¿½ which realigns our business architecture, organization and most importantly our people. This course provides the answers that management must know to be successful and realise the benefits:  ï¿½\tWhere should I go cloud?  ï¿½\tWhat are the commercials? ï¿½\tWhere is my leverage? ï¿½\tHow do I realign my business practices and architecture? ï¿½\tHow do I gear up my people and structure my organisation?

Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Advanced;Accounting has always been about analytical thinking. From the earliest days of the profession, Luca Pacioli emphasized the importance of math and order for analyzing business transactions. The skillset that accountants have needed to perform math and to keep order has evolved from pencil and paper, to typewriters and calculators, then to spreadsheets and accounting software. A new skillset that is becoming more important for nearly every aspect of business is that of big data analytics: analyzing large amounts of data to find actionable insights. This course is designed to help accounting students develop an analytical mindset and prepare them to use data analytic programming languages like Python and R.   Weï¿½ve divided the course into three main sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be  completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results.   In the second section of the course, we emphasize the importance of assembling data. Using financial statement data, we explain desirable characteristics of both data and datasets that will lead to effective calculations and visualizations.   In the third, and largest section of the course, we demonstrate and explore how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data. We describe visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations. We then examine fundamental data analytic tools, such as regression, linear programming (using Excel Solver), and clustering in the context of point of sale data and loan data. We conclude by demonstrating the power of data analytic programming languages to assemble, visualize, and analyze data. We introduce Visual Basic for Applications  as an example of a programming language, and the Visual Basic Editor as an example of an integrated development environment (IDE).;data clustering algorithms  analytics  tableau software  Microsoft Excel  Data Visualization  microsoft excel vba  Pivot Table  analysis  Data Analysis  software data-science data-analysis;1
Genomics: Decoding the Universal Language of Life;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Intermediate;What is a genome? A genome contains all of the information that a cell needs to develop, function, and reproduce itself, and all the information needed for those cells to come together to form a person, plant, or animal. Genomes contain an organismï¿½s complete set of genes, and also the even tinier genetic structures that help regulate when and how those genes are used.  The ability to regrow a torn ligament, the clues that might predict the onset of mental illness, the nutritional potential of crops, and even the history of life itself, are all encoded in genomes. By taking this course, you will discover how scientists are deciphering the language of genomes to learn how to develop sustainable food and fuel supplies, improve disease treatment and prevention, and protect our environment.   Professor Robinson is the main instructor for this course. In addition, each module features several guest instructors.

Impute Data to Forecast Demand in Google Sheets;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;This course will introduce you to cleaning data and replacing missing values with imputed data to support demand forecasting. Demand forecasts are used to maximize revenue, build efficiencies in operational planning, and to drive future growth. Forecasting techniques can be applied to make realistic predictions of outcomes of everything from how demand affects pricing and sales opportunities to operational planning for electrical utilities and healthcare facilities. We can only have confidence in the demand predictions we produce, when we also have confidence in the data quality feeding those predictions. Ensuring that confidence requires using clean data with no missing values for our forecast models. Handling missing data is an essential part of prepping clean data for a demand forecast.  In this course, we will review the principles of applying central measures of tendency and regression techniques to impute missing values. As you clean the data, you will visualize it with charts, replace inconsistent values and impute values while comparing the outcomes of the statistical techniques you have applied. When your data is clean, you will create a demand forecast. You will do this as we work side-by-side in the free-to-use software Google Sheets.  By the end of this course, you will understand use cases for imputing missing values and be able to confidently apply multiple statistical imputation techniques in any spreadsheet software.

The Brain and Space;Duke University;Intermediate;This course is about how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.  Knowing where things are is effortless.  But ï¿½under the hood;ï¿½ your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo ï¿½ these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brainï¿½s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brainï¿½s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.  The material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are, and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press.   The course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.  Dr. Jennifer M.

Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern;University of Geneva;Intermediate;What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ?   Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base.   In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.  This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, Rï¿½publique et Canton de Genï¿½ve, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.  By the end of this course, you will be able :  - to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions - to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies - to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions - to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health  - to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.  Your acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.  This MOOC on ï¿½Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concernï¿½ was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences.

Time to Reorganize! Understand Organizations, Act, and Build a Meaningful World.;HEC Paris;Advanced;We are in constant relationship with many organizations. Our world is submitted to regular changes as organizations evolve, come and go. Understanding your memberships and attachments to organizations will help you act on your world. You'll learn how to evaluate the influence of organizations around you and how to transform your relationships to reach a stronger coherence.  Do you feel sometime that the world around you is disorganized? Can you make sense of all the information at your reach and have an impact on this situation? Have you ever thought that this conundrum may be due to all the organizations that emerge, strive or wane, and disappear every day?   Organizations are ubiquitous, from clubs and associations to firms and public agencies. Organizations confer meaning to all of us, and our attachment and membership to organizations have a profound effect on all areas of our lives. But in our increasingly turbulent world, these organizations run the risk of disappearing or losing their legitimacy, steering a sense of pointlessness and absurdity.  This course develops an integrative approach to understanding organizations and their behaviors, termed ï¿½orgologyï¿½. It explains that organizations can act strategically to protect and renew the sense of membership and attachment of individuals. So doing, organizations that survive and thrive impose their logics of action onto society, thereby influencing what is legitimate or not.    In turn, individuals, you, all of us, must reinterpret our multiple associations with organizations and contribute to reinforce or inhibit social evolutions. This new way of understanding organizationsï¿½ relationships with society results in reconsidering management and the role of individuals in building their future.  There is no prerequisite to this course, you are all welcome ! Students and people interested in the fields of management, sociology, strategy, economics leadership etcï¿½ will benefit a lot from this course.  For the session of this course starting on January 11th, Professor Rodolphe Durand will actively be participating and interacting with learners.

Silicon Thin Film Solar Cells;École Polytechnique;Advanced;This course consists of a general presentation of solar cells based on silicon thin films.   It is the third MOOC of the photovoltaic series of Ecole polytechnique on Coursera. The general aspects of the photovoltaic field are treated in Photovoltaic Solar Energy. And the detailed description of the crystalline silicon solar cells can be found in Physics of Silicon Solar Cells.  After a brief presentation of solar cells operation, thin film semiconductors are described here. The general properties of disordered and crystalline semiconductors are found very different, in particular in terms of band structure and doping mechanisms. Silicon thin films, generally less than 1 ï¿½m thick, are deposited from silane plasma leading to hydrogen incorporation. The growth mechanisms are discussed, in particular the capability to prepare partially crystallized thin films which appear as a mixture of nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous tissue.  The consequences of the semiconductor properties on solar cells behavior are reviewed. The optical properties of amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon are complementary. Thus the plasma process is particularly well adapted to the preparation of multijunctions, with conversion efficiencies around 13-15 %. Furthermore plasma processes allow to prepare solar cells in large area on glass or flexible substrates.  Finally, it is shown that crystalline and amorphous silicon materials can be combine into heterojunctions solar cells with high efficiency conversion (about 25 %).  **This course is part of a series of 3** Photovoltaic solar energy (https://www.coursera.org/learn/photovoltaic-solar-energy/) Physics of silicon solar cells (https://www.coursera.org/learn/physics-silicon-solar-cells/) Silicon thin film solar cells;chemistry  physics  Solar Energy  film  lambda calculus  Electrical Engineering  electronics  energy  silicon  thinning physical-science-and-engineering electrical-engineering;1

Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking;University of Michigan;Beginner;Have you ever heard that computers think? Believe it or not, computers really do not think. Instead, they do exactly what we tell them to do. Programming is, telling the computer what to do and how to do it.  Before you can think about programming a computer, you need to work out exactly what it is you want to tell the computer to do. Thinking through problems this way is Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking allows us to take complex problems, understand what the problem is, and develop solutions. We can present these solutions in a way that both computers and people can understand.  The course includes an introduction to computational thinking and a broad definition of each concept, a series of real-world cases that illustrate how computational thinking can be used to solve complex problems, and a student project that asks you to apply what they are learning about Computational Thinking in a real-world situation. This project will be completed in stages (and milestones) and will also include a final disaster response plan you'll share with other learners like you.  This course is designed for anyone who is just beginning programming, is thinking about programming or simply wants to understand a new way of thinking about problems critically. No prior programming is needed. The examples in this course may feel particularly relevant to a High School audience and were designed to be understandable by anyone.  You will learn: -To define Computational Thinking components including abstraction, problem identification, decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithms, and evaluating solutions -To recognize Computational Thinking concepts in practice through a series of real-world case examples -To develop solutions through the application of Computational Thinking concepts to real world problems;Epidemiology  relative change and difference  decomposition  Problem Solving  evaluation  problem statement  Computational Thinking  human trafficking  Algorithms  hindley milner type system computer-science algorithms;0

The Holocaust - An Introduction (I): Nazi Germany: Ideology, The Jews and the World;Tel Aviv University;Beginner;The Holocaust was an inconceivable historical event, which forever robbed Western culture of its innocence. As civilized human beings, we fail to understand how events of such horror could have taken place, and how an idea so inhumanly warped could have spread like wildfire through an entire continent, instigating the systematic annihilation of millions of Jews.  This free online course was produced jointly by Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem ï¿½ the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. The course tracks the history of the Holocaust and has two parts. The Holocaust - An Introduction (I): Nazi Germany: Ideology, The Jews and the World is the first of the two courses and covers the following themes in its three weeks:  Week 1: From Hatred to Core Ideology We will try to delve into Nazi ideology and the special place of Jews and Judaism in it. We will also discuss how the National Socialist Party converted the German Democracy of the Weimar Republic into a totalitarian regime within a short period of time, and its meaning for Jews and non-Jewish citizens.  Week 2: The World and the Jews in World War II We will try to examine the broader contexts of the Holocaust and to place it, as part of World War 2. In this meeting we will also refer to the vital Jewish world to be found under various Nazi occupations and influences.  Week 3: The Isolation Abyss - the Perspective of the Individual We will try to reveal different aspects of Jewish life in the face of the badge of shame, ghettos and segregation, as well as the formation of individual, societiesï¿½ and leaderï¿½s reactions in the face of a consistent policy of dispossession and discrimination.  Once youï¿½ve completed this course, you can continue your learning with The Holocaust - An Introduction (II): The Final Solution (https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-2/home/welcome)   This online course is offered in an innovative, multi-level format, comprising:  * Comprehensive lectures by leading researchers from Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem. * A wealth of voices and viewpoints presented by guest lecturers. * Numerous documents, photos, testimonies and works of art from the time of the Holocaust. * Novel learning experience: Crowd sourcing ï¿½ involving the learners themselves in the act of collecting and shaping information, via unique, exciting online assignments.

Economics of Money and Banking;Columbia University;Intermediate;The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.  Three features of the new system are central.  Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.    Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order.   Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.;crisis  Banking  Finance  shadow banking system  economy  Economics  market (economics)  global  money market  shadow banning social-sciences economics;2
Validity and Bias in Epidemiology;Imperial College London;Intermediate;Epidemiological studies can provide valuable insights about the frequency of a disease, its potential causes and the effectiveness of available treatments. Selecting an appropriate study design can take you a long way when trying to answer such a question. However, this is by no means enough. A study can yield biased results for many different reasons. This course offers an introduction to some of these factors and provides guidance on how to deal with bias in epidemiological research. In this course you will learn about the main types of bias and what effect they might have on your study findings. You will then focus on the concept of confounding and you will explore various methods to identify and control for confounding in different study designs. In the last module of this course we will discuss the phenomenon of effect modification, which is key to understanding and interpreting study results. We will finish the course with a broader discussion of causality in epidemiology and we will highlight how you can utilise all the tools that you have learnt to decide whether your findings indicate a true association and if this can be considered causal.;observational error  Selection Bias  Epidemiology  Clinical Study Design  Confounding  Causality  Causal Inference  interaction (statistics)  risk factors  bias life-sciences public-health;2

Wood Science: Beyond Building;West Virginia University;Beginner;The central question of this course: ï¿½why study wood?ï¿½ If ï¿½why study woodï¿½ is the question, one answer would be that it is the only raw material available to us that is truly renewable in human life span terms. Wood is as important to society today as it ever was, despite the development of many man-made substitute materials, changing resource availability, and the changing needs of society.  Some items on the list of wood products stay the same (lumber, plywood and veneer for building construction, furniture, shipping pallets & crates and other containers & packaging materials, railroad ties, utility poles, chemical feed stocks, etc), but the list also keeps changing to meet new needs and challenges as the resource changes.

Urban Nature: Connecting Cities, Nature and Innovation;Lund University;Beginner;How can nature help us design and build our cities? Nature-based solutions have the potential to provide multiple benefits across a range of sustainability challenges facing cities. They can help to limit the impacts of climate change, enhance biodiversity and improve environmental quality while contributing to economic activities and social well-being.  But what are nature-based solutions? Examples include green roofs and city parks that reduce heat, city lagoons that can store water as well as vegetation and rain gardens to intercept storm water.  This course will explore nature-based solutions in cities in Europe and around the world. It will connect together the key themes of nature, cities and innovation. We will discuss how to assess what nature-based solutions can achieve in cities. We will examine how innovation is taking place in cities. And we will analyse the potential of nature-based solutions to help respond to climate change and sustainability challenges.  This course combines both technical knowledge and the social sciences to better understand nature-based solutions in a holistic perspective. New governance arrangements, business models and financing, forms of citizen engagement and innovation pathways will be needed to make the promise of nature-based solutions a reality.

Making Progress Teach-Out;Emory University;Beginner;What is ï¿½progressï¿½? How do we decide when weï¿½re moving forward and not taking steps backward? And how do we explore the idea of progress around public sites of memory? This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you areï¿½in your city, community, or neighborhoodï¿½and reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.  Changes in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plansï¿½our attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives.   This Teach-Out will ask the following questions: ï¿½\tWhat are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit?  ï¿½\tHow do people connect with places in our modern cities?  ï¿½\tDo places progress?  ï¿½\tHow can we measure in them whether there is any ï¿½progressï¿½?   We will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.  A Teach-Out is:  ï¿½ an event ï¿½ it takes place over a fixed, short period of time  ï¿½ an opportunity ï¿½ it is open for free participation to everyone around the world  ï¿½ a community ï¿½ it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals  ï¿½ a conversation ï¿½ an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people   This community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emoryï¿½s commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society.   Originating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community.

Evidence-based Toxicology;Johns Hopkins University;Intermediate;Welcome to the Evidence-based Toxicology (EBT) course. In medicine and healthcare, evidence-based medicine has revolutionized the way that information is evaluated transparently and objectively. Over the past ten years, a movement in North America and Europe has attempted to translate this revolution to the field of toxicology. The Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) within the department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health hosts the first chair for EBT and the secretariat for the EBT Collaboration on both sides of the Atlantic. Based on the Cochrane Collaboration in Evidence-based Medicine, the EBT Collaboration was established at the CAAT to foster the development of a process for quality assurance of new toxicity tests for the assessment of safety in humans and the environment. Regulatory safety sciences have undergone remarkably little change in the past fifty years. At the same time, our knowledge in the life sciences is doubling about every seven years. Systematic review and related evidence-based approaches are beginning to be adapted by regulatory agencies like the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the US National Toxicology Program. They provide transparent, objective, and consistent tools to identify, select, appraise, and extract evidence across studies.

Business Analytics, Big Data and Data Science are very hot topics today, and for good reasons. Companies are sitting on a treasure trove of data, but usually lack the skills and people to analyze and exploit that data efficiently. Those companies who develop the skills and hire the right people to analyze and exploit that data will have a clear competitive advantage.  It's especially true in one domain: marketing. About 90% of the data collected by companies today are related to customer actions and marketing activities.The domain of Marketing Analytics is absolutely huge, and may cover fancy topics such as text mining, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, real-time bidding, online campaign optimization, and so on.  But at the heart of marketing lie a few basic questions that often remain unanswered: (1) who are my customers, (2) which customers should I target and spend most of my marketing budget on, and (3) what's the future value of my customers so I can concentrate on those who will be worth the most to the company in the future.  That's exactly what this course will cover: segmentation is all about understanding your customers, scorings models are about targeting the right ones, and customer lifetime value is about anticipating their future value. These are the foundations of Marketing Analytics. And that's what you'll learn to do in this course.;predictive analytics  analytics  market (economics)  Stochastic Matrix  Market Analysis  customer lifetime value  Marketing  market segmentation  Data Analysis  analysis business marketing;2

Mind of the Universe - Genetic Privacy: should we be concerned?;Universiteit Leiden;Beginner;Should all our genetic information be made public in order to eradicate genetic diseases from this world? Who owns your genetic data once it becomes publicly accessible? What is your responsibility to family members when you know more about genetic diseases than they do? Who decides what kind of genetic information is relevant to a person? And what does genetic privacy mean to you?  In this challenge with Robert Zwijnenberg (Professor in Art and Science Interactions) you will critically reflect upon the issue of genetic privacy. You will dive into the ethical questions that come up with the disclosure of genetic data in biobanks and through genetic tests. This course encourages you to think about the cultural, philosophical and political tensions present in the debate around genetic privacy. You are invited to identify and listen to the viewpoints and values provided by the different stakeholders that shape this debate: corporations, researchers, consumers and patients. Furthermore, you will go off the beaten track by exploring the issue from the unique perspective of art and culture. After a lot of thinking, supplementing, deleting and adjusting, you will be asked to share a recommendation on how to regulate practices of disclosing genetic information, while taking into consideration the concept of genetic privacy. Your advice could serve as an eye-opener for policy makers!  This online learning experience is a spin-off of The Mind of the Universe documentary series created by the Dutch broadcasting company VPRO and professor Robbert Dijkgraaf, Princeton University.

Financing and Investing in Infrastructure;Università Bocconi;Intermediate;Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments!   According to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.  The European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.  Traditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business.   The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments.   The course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.  In the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.  Course Format The course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.  Suggested Readings The course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course.

The huge amount of data the algorithms need to process and their complexity raised the problem of increasing the amount of computational power needed to perform the computation. In this scenario, hardware accelerators revealed to be effective in achieving a speed-up in the computation while, at the same time, saving power consumption. Among the algorithms used in computational biology, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm, guaranteed to find the optimal local alignment between two strings that could be nucleotides or proteins. In the following classes, we present an analysis and successive FPGA-based hardware acceleration of the Smith-Waterman algorithm used to perform pairwise alignment of DNA sequences.  Within this context, this course is focusing on distributed, heterogeneous cloud infrastructures, providing you details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel, through working examples, to bring your solutions to life by using the Amazon EC2 F1 instances.;data centers  Cloud Computing  porting  stack (abstract data type)  Software As A Service  Cloud Infrastructure  flow network  Algorithms  systolic array  Cloud Applications computer-science design-and-product;1

The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future;Emory University;Beginner;With its walls razed to ground by Babylonï¿½s armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished citiesï¿½from Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.     Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanityï¿½s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authorsï¿½ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life.;pragmatics  bible  ordered pair  religion  history  project  conquesting  israel  law  education arts-and-humanities history;0

Build an App in Android Studio using onTouch;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;In this project you will build an Android app that that uses onTouch functionality to show certain information when a user clicks (Action Down) on an image, and then have the information change when the user releases (Action Up). The app also creates text files in internal storage when needed, will write to those files, and will read from those files.  The app will interact with text files, images, strings, and a string array that are saved as resources in the project (can be accessed by reference throughout the app). This app will have a piece of text (from the strings file) asking the user to select the name of an author from a spinner (a type of drop down menu where the user selects from a set of options - from the strings file). There will be an image (ImageView) below the spinner which will change (from the drawable directory) to match whichever author the user selects. Beneath this will be a piece of text (TextView) with the name of a book and the year it was published (from the strings file) which will change to match the selected author. There will be another piece of text (TextView) which will contain an appropriate quote (read from the appropriate text file in a raw directory) from the named book  Below this quote will be two buttons, one with Read Review on it, and the second with Submit Review on it.  When the user clicks the Read Review button a TextView will appear containing a the previously submitted review (if one exists). The user will also be given the option to Submit Review whiich when clicked gives access to an imput box (EditText) into which a review can be typed.  When a Submit button is then clicked this review is written to a text file in internal storage (not resources) to a review file for that author.  If the file does not exist then the app will create the file first, then write the review to it. When the user closes the app the program will remember the final choice made by the user in their previous visit. When launched the app will also read all information in the review files in internal storage and bring the reviews into the app for use. You will upload an APK of the app to a website called Appetize.io to test the app.  Projects in Series 1: 1. Build a Simple App in Android Studio with Java 2.

Programming Languages, Part A;University of Washington;Intermediate;This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language ï¿½fits togetherï¿½ to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.  This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.  The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.  The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.  Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.;inference  ml (programming language)  higher-order function  functional programming  type inference  pattern matching  euler's totient function  language  ?-recursive function  Computer Programming computer-science software-development;2

Mathematical Game Theory;Saint Petersburg State University;Advanced;Every day, almost every minute we make a choice. Right now you have made the choice to read this text instead of scrolling further. Choices can be insignificant: to go by tram or by bus, to take an umbrella or not. Sometimes they can be very significant and even crucial: the choice of University, life partner. However, the importance of choice may not be realized initially. Sometimes a decision not to take an umbrella radically changes everything.   The choice may affect a small group of people or entire countries. In game ?theory, we call it the choice of strategy. Constantly interacting with society and adopting certain strategies, many of us wonder: why can't everyone exist peacefully and cooperate with each other? Why do those who have agreed to cooperate, suddenly break the agreement? What if one is cooperative and the other is not? How profitable should the interaction be for the opponent to change his opinion? When are long-term stable prospects better than short-term benefits, and when not?   The answers to these and other questions you will find out in our course.   This course will be useful for those who want to make choices based on mathematical calculations rather than relying on fate. Who is interested in world politics and at least once heard about the Prisoner's Dilemma.   The course is basic and does not require any special knowledge.

Programming Languages, Part C;University of Washington;Advanced;[As described below, this is Part C of a 3-part course.  Participants should complete Parts A and B first -- Part C dives right in and refers often to material from Part A and Part B.]  This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language ï¿½fits togetherï¿½ to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.  This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.  The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module of Part A.  Part B assumes successful completion of Part A.  The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.    Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.;euler's totient function  Computer Programming  closure (computer programming)  bounded quantification  functional programming  subtyping  language  type system  ruby (programming language)  ordered pair computer-science software-development;1

Developing FPGA-accelerated cloud applications with SDAccel: Theory;Politecnico di Milano;Advanced;This course is for anyone passionate in learning how to develop FPGA-accelerated applications with SDAccel!  We are entering in an era in which technology progress induces paradigm shifts in computing! As a tradeoff between the two extreme characteristics of GPP and ASIC, we can find a new concept, a new idea of computing... the reconfigurable computing, which has combined the advantages of both the previous worlds. Within this context, we can say that reconfigurable computing will widely, pervasively, and gradually impact human lives. Hence, it is time that we focus on how reconfigurable computing and reconfigurable system design techniques are to be utilised for building applications.  One one hand reconfigurable computing can have better performance with respect to a software implementation but paying this in terms of time to implement. On the other hand a reconfigurable device can be used to design a system without requiring the same design time and complexity compared to a full custom solution but being beaten in terms of performance. Within this context, the Xilinx SDx tools, including the SDAccel environment, the SDSoC environment, and Vivado HLS, provide an out-of-the-box experience for system programmers looking to partition elements of a software application to run in an FPGA-based hardware element, and having that hardware work seamlessly with the rest of the application running in a processor or embedded processor.   The out-of-the-box experience will provide interesting and, let us say, ï¿½good enoughï¿½ results for many applications.  However, this may not be true for you, you may be looking for better performance, data throughput, reduced latency, or to reduce the resources usage... This course is focusing exactly on this. After introducing you to the FPGAs we are going to dig more into the details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel providing you also with working examples on how to optimize the hardware logic to obtain the best of of your hardware implementations. In this case, certain attributes, directives, or pragmas, can be used to direct the compilation and synthesis of the hardware kernel, or to optimise the function of the data mover operating between the processor and the hardware logic. Furthermore, In this course we are going to focus on distributed, heterogeneous infrastructures, presenting how to bring your solutions to life by using the Amazon EC2 F1 instances.;software  computational model  logic gate  Software As A Service  host system  Cloud Computing  System V  iteration  Cloud Applications  mathematical optimization computer-science design-and-product;1

From the Big Bang to Dark Energy;The University of Tokyo;Beginner;We have learned a lot recently about how the Universe evolved in 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang. More than 80% of matter in the Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to form. The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the Universe. Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. The expansion of the Universe started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and the Universe is being ripped apart. The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy multiplying in vacuum. I will present evidence behind these startling discoveries and discuss what we may learn in the near future.

Building Containerized Applications on AWS;Amazon Web Services;Beginner;This course introduces you to container technologies and how they can be used to modernize your applications, as well as exploring how different AWS services can be used to manage and orchestrate those containers.  Container technologies have existed for years, and are still gaining popularity. Two of the most prevalent options are Docker and Kubernetes - each with its own distinct set of features. Regardless of which technology you choose, one of the biggest challenges with containers is their orchestration. Unlike traditional, monolithic applications where you can only scale at a macro level - an executable, for example - containerized applications scale at the container level. When coupled with a microservices approach, each container can contain the code necessary to execute a single task or function. While this provides a number of benefits, a single application can consist of hundreds of containerized microservices. How do you handle starting, stopping, scaling out and scaling in all of these containers?  AWS offers a number of services that help with container orchestration, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Throughout this course, expert instructors will dive deep into these services as well as general container technologies and capabilities.  This course uses a combination of video-based lectures, delivered by AWS technical trainers, demonstrations, and hands-on lab exercises to enable you to deploy and manage a containerized application.;Kubernetes  microservices  docker (software)  subnetwork  command-line interface  node.js  macro (computer science)  service discovery  virtual machine  Operating Systems information-technology cloud-computing;0

Understanding the Music Business: What is Music Worth?;Vanderbilt University;Advanced;This course will examine the music industry in the United States, with the unique perspective gained by Vanderbilt Universityï¿½s location in Nashville, TN.  Nashville is a major center of music in the United States, and the music created here has a global reach, particularly in the country, rock, pop, singer-songwriter, and Americana genres.  However, students will learn that the basic principles of recording, marketing, copyright, licensing, and live performance are the same, regardless of musical style or genre.  The music business is one of the most rapidly changing industries in the US today.  It is also an industry filled with contradiction, and media headlines and anecdotal stories often add to the confusion.  Here are just a few statements paraphrased from recent news stories:   * The music business has collapsed * Demand for music is expanding at the greatest rate in history * Historic recording studios are closing at an alarming rate * More people are making recordings than ever before * Musicians usually lose money touring * Musicians usually make money touring * Major artist pulls songs off streaming services because they donï¿½t pay fairly * Major artist makes a fortune from streaming services * People wonï¿½t buy records anymore * Vinyl record sales are soaring  This course will attempt to make sense of these seemingly contradictory trends and data, outline the basic structure and mechanisms of todayï¿½s music industry, and encourage students to think critically and entrepreneurially about the future of music.  Leaders from various areas of the music business will lend their perspectives through in-depth interviews, and footage from a recording session will give learners a behind the scenes look at how a song goes from the spark of an idea hummed into a cell phone to a finished recording.  Participants will grapple with questions about art and commerce which are both timeless and crucially important today, and will emerge from this course with tools allowing them to make more informed decisions as creators, promoters, and consumers of music.

Java Built in Data Structures;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;In this project you will read weather data from a file and populate a Java ArrayList with the file data. The data is then uniquified in a Set data structure and stored in a HashMap for accessing data by year.  Java's collections framework contains data structures that are built for efficiency. They are used to store and retrieve data in various formats. A list such as an ArrayList can be used in place of an array to contain data where the size cannot be determined ahead of time. A LinkeList is like an ArrayList, except elements can be more quickly added and deleted from it, since no shifting needs to occur. A Hashmap is used to quickly look up a value based on a key rather than a numerical index, for example, to look up a phone number based on a key containing a person's name. A Set may be used to remove duplicates from a list, simply by assigning the data to it.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Protecting Public Health in a Changing Climate:  A Primer for City, Local, and Regional Action;Johns Hopkins University;Intermediate;This course is an introduction to the multiple ways our changing climate affects global population health, and to promising policy and practice responses.  More intense storms, heatwaves, and rising seas mean many, particularly the most vulnerable, now face growing risks of weather-related injury, illness, mental stress and even death. Because people care deeply about health outcomes, public health has great potential to convey the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to a warmer, more unpredictable climate.  The main message of the course is that public health must therefore ï¿½lean inï¿½ and become a more central player in climate change mitigation and adaptation.  Because climate-related health risks happen mainly at the local level, the course focuses on cities ï¿½ increasingly key players in climate change policy.  Starting with an overview of the science consensus suggesting we have 10-20 years to prevent risks associated with exceeding 1.5ï¿½C of global warming and put in place adaptive policies, the course provides interactive lectures, expert interviews and case studies that build practical knowledge.  In the final assignment, participants apply course tools and strategies to a city of their choice, preparing them to contribute to climate mitigation and building health resiliency in their own local context.;public health  food security  water quality  climate change  global  Strategy  Urban Planning  mental health  Risk  Transporting life-sciences public-health;2

Understanding Memory: Explaining the Psychology of Memory through Movies;Wesleyan University;Beginner;Welcome to Understanding Memory. Someone once said that memory is fascinating because sometimes we forget what we want to remember, sometimes we remember what we want to forget, and sometimes we remember events that never happened or never happened the way we remember them. I want to show you how memory works, why it sometimes fails, and what we can do to enhance it. Based on my recent book ï¿½ Memory and Movies: What Films Can Teach Us About Memory (MIT Press, 2015) ï¿½ I will provide an introduction to the scientific study of human memory by focusing on a select group of topics that hold widespread appeal.   To facilitate your understanding, I will use clips from numerous films to illustrate different aspects of memory ï¿½ describing what has been learned about memory in a nontechnical way for people with no prior background in psychology. Many of us love watching movies because they offer an unparalleled opportunity for entertainment, even if entertaining films are not always scientifically accurate. Still, I believe that we can learn a lot about memory from popular films, if we watch them with an educated eye. Welcome once more. I am looking forward to showing you what movies can teach us about memory.

The Science of Success: What Researchers Know that You Should Know;University of Michigan;Beginner;This engaging course is designed to help you achieve the success that you desire. Drawing on decades of scientific research, you will learn what the most successful people do differently than others, why IQ is not the most significant predictor of success (and can sometimes backfire), and why many commonly held beliefs hold people back from achieving their goals.  Although this course is based on the science of success, you will learn many practical ideas that you can apply to your own life immediately, particularly in three main areas:  ï¿½\tGetting better results at work (and school)  ï¿½\tAchieving career success (however you define success)  ï¿½\tEnjoying a meaningful, happy, and healthy life  By the time you finish this course you will know more than most people know about what predicts success in life. One of the most important lessons youï¿½ll learn is that success is earned day-by-day through small wins - small, achievable actions that together can help you achieve your goals sooner and exceed even your own expectations. Therefore, you will have an opportunity to complete a detailed action plan through which you can turn what you learned into specific steps for achieving your most treasured life goals.;goal setting  time management  Self-Motivation  personal advertisement  personal branding  Planning  Leadership and Management  self-awareness  social capital  leadership business leadership-and-management;0
Revolutionary Ideas: Borders, Elections, Constitutions, Prisons;Rutgers the State University of New Jersey;Intermediate;What is the purpose of government?  Why should we have a State?  What kind of State should we have?  Even within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements.   All political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the worldï¿½s most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers such as Plato, Hugo Grotius, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, and more contemporary theorists such as Michelle Alexander, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Bryan Caplan, Angela Davis, Ronald Dworkin, Jon Elster, John Hart Ely, H.L.A. Hart, Michael Huemer, Andrew Rehfeld, and Jeremy Waldron.  The aim of the course is not to convince you of the correctness of any particular view or political position, but to provide you with a deeper and more philosophically-informed basis for your own views, and, perhaps, to help you better understand the views of those with whom you disagree.;Art History  crime  semantics  law  elections  Economics  Criminal Justice  prisons  constitution  prison arts-and-humanities philosophy;2
Diagnosing Health Behaviors for Global Health Programs;Johns Hopkins University;Advanced;Health behavior lies at the core of any successful public health intervention. While we will examine the behavior of individual in depth in this course, we also recognize by way of the Ecological Model that individual behavior is encouraged or constrained by the behavior of families, social groups, communities, organizations and policy makers. We recognize that behavior change is not a simplistic process but requires an understanding of dimensions like frequency, complexity and cultural congruity. Such behavioral analysis is strengthened through the use of a toolkit of theoretical models and practical frameworks. While many of such models and frameworks exist, in this course we will review the Health Belief Model, Social Learning Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, the Trans-Theoretical Model and the PRECEDE Framework. After building your behavioral analysis toolkit with these examples, you will see that actual behavior change program planning uses a combination of ideas and variables from different models, theories and frameworks. Ultimately we aim to encourage course participants to apply the idea that successful programs are theory based as they go about involving people in improving their health.;human behavior  affordance  observational learning  case study  behavior  emergency medicine  modeling  interpretation  force fields  perception life-sciences public-health;1
Retrieve Data with Multiple-Table SQL Queries;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;In this course you will be introduced to two methods of writing SQL queries that retrieve data from two or more tables. Since one of the functions of a database is to store data in an organized format, many databases are made up of multiple tables. Often, the data output required from the database is made up of data from more than one table. For example, the data that populates a student transcript might come from the Student, Course, and Section tables. While the Student table may provide the studentï¿½s name, the name and number of the course might come from the Course table and the specific grade for that course may come from yet another table. While writing SQL queries in SQLiteStudio, you'll learn the SQL syntax required to join tables together as you develop an understanding of how the relationships among tables come into play.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. Weï¿½re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.;relational database  data retrieval  Databases  transact-sql  online shopping  Data Structures  Student's t-Distribution  associative entity  telephone number  SQL information-technology data-management;0

Advanced Valuation and Strategy - M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital;Erasmus University Rotterdam;Advanced;Hi and welcome to this course!   Would you like to learn about the latest valuation methods that may help you to make better business decisions? Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy ï¿½ M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!  We will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firmï¿½s long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.  Our treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?  The tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.  * Who is this class for? We hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience. This course is particularly interesting for venture capitalists, private equity investors, investment bankers, CEOs, CFOs, and those who aspire these affiliations. We offer this MOOC at 3 levels:  1.Executive Summary:  This 1-week module provides critical insights into the principles of corporate valuation and strategy. This is accessible for time-constrained executives and the general audience without any prior knowledge.  2. Student Level: This level involves an understanding of the technical details.  This level requires basic knowledge of concepts in corporate finance, e.g., the time value of money, financial statement analysis, capital structure, and the relation between risk and returns. Learners of this level can skip week 1.  3.

Principles of Corporate Finance ï¿½  A Tale of Value;Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology;Advanced;The study of Corporate Finance seems to be a very generic part of business education. Still, it either falls in the trap of intimidating formulas or is superficially journalistic. Both extremes preclude the understanding of the core finance ideas, concepts, and models. This Course is an attempt to avoid the above extremes. We discuss the core basis and mechanisms of modern corporate finance in a learner-friendly way. We will analyze the marketï¿½s most fundamental problems, realize the intrinsic interests and preferences of investors, reveal the true meaning of specific financial terms, and uncover important issues that are so often ignored in choosing and valuing investment projects.

Meditation: A way to achieve your goals in your life;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST);Beginner;Do we truly think that we have lived for ourselves? Perhaps we have lived for money, love, fame, family and pride etc.? Therefore, we donï¿½t seem to be satisfied even though we are full of those things. It is because that we donï¿½t know ourselves.  Eric Fromm talked about human nature as two modes of being: ï¿½To Haveï¿½ and ï¿½To Beï¿½.  If we are ï¿½Havingï¿½ the nature of possessions, we are not satisfied, and feel empty and futile. Then, how can we be ï¿½Beingï¿½ the nature of our inner-selves?  Sometimes, we happened to be aware of this ï¿½Beingï¿½ nature and try to change ourselves, but fail. But, because of our daily routines, itï¿½s easily forgotten. And more it is hard to escape from our unwanted minds controlling us.  From now on, let us reflect on ourselves and look at our minds leading up to today! Donï¿½t we achieve our goals after knowing ourselves? And let us find the ï¿½Beingï¿½ nature of our original selves after escaping from the minds restraining and controlling us.  In this lecture, the definition and principle of the mind are explained in simple and clear ways. You can make sure and practice the methodology of finding the true original mind of inner-self by escaping from the false mind of possession.   Self-reflection is the first step to meditate. You can know yourselves most objectively through meditation and you will realize that all the thoughts and actions are due to your minds which are nonexistent and false. If you throw away the false mind, you will find the true mind.  Meditation is now world-wide sensation. There are many research reports that show people can be leaders if you have a habit of self-reflection through meditation. Now meditation at school and the workplace are popular.  Happiness is having no worries. You can really relax yourself if there is no bundle of thoughts and you can be successful when you know yourself truly. Worries come from the memorized thoughts of the false mind. Your inner potential of positive power are revealed, your peaceful and happiest mind will be in your mind, and you can live the life you wanted through meditation.  This method of meditation is very practical and everybody can follow the methodology. As an engineer, I will guide you step by step to practice this meditation. I am sure that this lecture becomes a turning point in your life.;mindfulness  mind control  korean language  happiness  meditation  philosophy of mind  mindfulness (psychology)  guided meditation  self-reflection  thought arts-and-humanities philosophy;0
Disability Inclusion in Education: Building Systems of Support;University of Cape Town;Intermediate;Worldwide millions of children are not able to fully participate in schooling, and this is especially a problem for children with disabilities. In this course, we explore the support that teachers need in order to meet the needs of children with severe to profound hearing, visual and intellectual disabilities.  We consider how this can be done by talking with a range of experts (from teachers to activists) about inclusive education as well as sharing experiences of education.   Inclusive education is only possible if teachers are supported and empowered to make the curriculum accessible to all learners. The topics in this course cover developing disability confidence and what exactly children with specific impairments need to be able to learn. This includes sharing specific classroom strategies and teaching activities for learners who are D/deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision or have a severe to profound intellectual disability. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with the impairment specific needs of learners with disabilities, and how to build systems of support for inclusive education.  You will be able to purchase a Verified Certificate if you wish to show evidence of your achievements, but this is optional, and you may apply for Financial Aid if you are unable to pay the certificate fee.

Programming Languages, Part B;University of Washington;Advanced;[As described below, this is Part B of a 3-part course.  Participants should complete Part A first -- Part B dives right in and refers often to material from Part A.]  This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language ï¿½fits togetherï¿½ to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.  This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.  The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module of Part A.  Part B assumes successful completion of Part A.  The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.    Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.;type system  ordered pair  small (programming language)  lisp in small pieces  language  relative change and difference  racket (programming language)  Computer Programming  functional programming  closure (computer programming) computer-science software-development;1

The Language of Design: Form and Meaning;California Institute of the Arts;Beginner;In this course, critique is defined as a detailed, objective analysis of a work of graphic design and its effectiveness. Critique is an integral part of the making process for designers: itï¿½s not just how we determine if a work of design is or is not successful, itï¿½s how we move our work forward. Critique is also where other voices and opinions can be brought into the design process.   This course will introduce a lexicon (or vocabulary) in order for you to demonstrate clearer and more considered ways of talking about graphic design in the context of critique. Through this lexicon and a provided Critique Framework, we will model and then practice objectively describing how well a work of design functions based on specific, clearly articulated criteria. By refining this skill, you will enhance your ability to communicate about design with peers, colleagues, and clients.   This course is essential to anyone looking to develop and refine a critical vocabulary around talking about art and design, such as:  - practicing graphic designers at all levels  - future and current students of art or design programs  - teachers teaching visual art, design, or related subjects  - any stakeholder in a design project that needs to communicate effectively with designers on their team.    This course is recommended to learners enrolled in either the Graphic Design Specialization or UI/UX Design Specialization on Coursera to further develop their skills in graphic design. You may take this course before, during, or after completing either Specialization.   Note this is not an art appreciation course for a general audience. While no prior experience is required to begin, the knowledge and skills taught in this course is useful only if you have some relationship to design in a professional context, i.e., practicing, studying, or teaching design, or working directly with designers.  No specific software or tools are required to complete this course.;Communication  Visual Design  Interior Design  language  visual hierarchy  art  Computer Graphics  evaluation  visual language  Graphic Design arts-and-humanities music-and-art;0

The last two weeks of the first module will investigate consumer behavior more closely and show how consumer choices are driven by the interplay of preferences and budget constraints. We will employ the consumer choice framework to examine investor choice as well as policies such as ObamaCare and school choice. Finally, we will also address the concept of how to distribute a given amount of goods across a societyï¿½s consumers in the most efficient manner.;supply chain  price elasticity of demand  budget constraint  demand  consumer behaviour  consumer choice  marginal rate of substitution  indifference curve  school choice  supply and demand business business-essentials;2
Class Creation in Object Oriented Python;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;Python is an Object Oriented Language. Object Oriented languages allow the developer to think in terms of real-world objects, such as people, cars, and animals for example. In the procedural realm, developers think in terms of functions (or procedures) and the data those functions act on. By using objects, the data can be combined with functionality ï¿½ a person has eye color, an animal has behavior etc. This can lead to programs that are easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.  In this course, you will create a Python application in which you will create a class definition, create a constructor for the class, create object instances of the class, and sort a list of objects created from a file.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Finally, you will understand the most important needs and drivers of performance across cultures, and will learn to align rewards with desired behaviors so that your teammates are motivated to attain the teamï¿½s objectives.   Motivation represents a crucial challenge for contemporary organizations: A recent Gallup poll revealed that only 13% of workers worldwide exhibit high levels of engagement and motivation. We will show you why these motivation problems are not simply due to a ï¿½badï¿½ or ï¿½unmotivatedï¿½ team member. Rather, motivation is very much driven by what work conditions we create for our teammates, how we structure goals and objectives, and how we reward people for the accomplishment of those goals. This course will help you diagnose and solve motivation problems so that you can bring out the best in your people.;Communication  employee motivation  performance  performance appraisal  Leadership and Management  Leadership Development  team management  motivation  leadership  employment business leadership-and-management;2

Introduction to Imagemaking;California Institute of the Arts;Intermediate;This course for serious makers, and for students new to imagemaking. Imagemaking is a fluid and exciting area of graphic design that comes out of practice and process: experimenting fearlessly, showing and sharing ideas, and giving and receiving knowledgeable and constructive input.  For the sake of this online platform, we have applied some structure to our investigations, but for the most part imagemaking is loose and unstructured. If we must adopt a rule in this course it is only this: you will not become a graphic designer by watching videos alone. Or, don't just make stuff just in your head. So here, the focus here is on making, and you are expected to devote serious time and intellectual energy to that activity in this course. Specifically, you will:   - experiment with a range of materials and techniques to make images for graphic design  - expand your visual vocabulary both in terms of making and talking about work, in order to discuss your work and work of others  - learn how to make, manipulate and arrange images to create compositions, eventually culminating in the design and production of an-image-based book.  The first half of the course is an opportunity to experiment and explore imagemaking in order to expand your visual vocabulary. You will create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or 'design-y' to instigate, evoke, experiment, record, explain, or try out a media.  In the second two weeks, weï¿½ll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition, composition, and context. Weï¿½ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together by composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the imageï¿½s connotations, meanings, and associations generated through elements of composition and ï¿½visual contrasts.ï¿½ Ultimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.  The results of your assignments (and experiments) may generate something completely unknowable now or in the futureï¿½and that's the goal.;Computer Graphics  Graphic Design  iteration  Creativity  illustration  adobe photoshop  Booking  art  adobe indesign  Layout Design arts-and-humanities music-and-art;2

Firm Level Economics: Consumer and Producer Behavior;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Advanced;All goods and services are subject to scarcity at some level. Scarcity means that society must develop some allocation mechanism ï¿½ rules to determine who gets what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based ï¿½ the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium price ï¿½rationsï¿½ the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand.   After this course, you will be able to:  ï¿½\tDescribe consumer behavior as captured by the demand curve. ï¿½\tDescribe producer behavior as captured by the supply curve. ï¿½\tExplain equilibrium in a market. ï¿½\tExplain the impact of taxes and price controls on market equilibrium. ï¿½\tExplain elasticity of demand. ï¿½\tDescribe cost theory and how firms optimize given the constraints of their own costs and an exogenously given price.  This course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Sï¿½ren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity;University of Copenhagen;Intermediate;It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning, the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread in modernity.   The Danish thinker Sï¿½ren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one, the Greek philosopher Socrates.  In this course created by former associate professor at the Sï¿½ren Kierkegaard Research Centre, Jon Stewart, we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.;literary theory  philosophy  history  faith  dialogue  irony  thought  Poetry Writing  aporia  subjectivism arts-and-humanities philosophy;2

Presentation skills: Designing Presentation Slides;National Research Tomsk State University;Advanced;ï¿½Powerpoint slides are like children: no matter how ugly they are, youï¿½ll think theyï¿½re beautiful if theyï¿½re yoursï¿½ ï¿½ Scott Adams, author of the comic strip ï¿½Dilbertï¿½.  Due to this cause or another, itï¿½s a huge stress to look at most Powerpoint slides. Depending on the ï¿½designï¿½ skills of the speaker and audienceï¿½s taste slides create different emotions from a slight annoyance to physical sickness.  But that is not the worst thing. The worst thing is that instead of improving the presentation such slides confuse the audience, distract it and finally oblige the speaker to explain them rather than being quite self-explanatory.  The goal of this course is to change that by equipping learners with a set of tools to create simple, clear and aesthetic slides which improve the presentation of the speaker. The course covers universal design principles, templates, colors, typefaces, slidesï¿½ typography, use of photos and pictograms, composition rules and ways to create clear and meaningful charts and diagrams.  This course is not a PowerPoint fundamentals course. You should have a basic knowledge of either Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote software.

Visualization for Data Journalism;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign;Advanced;While telling stories with data has been part of the news practice since its earliest days, it is in the midst of a renaissance. Graphics desks which used to be deemed as ï¿½the art department;ï¿½ a subfield outside the work of newsrooms, are becoming a core part of newsroomsï¿½ operation. Those people (they often have various titles: data journalists, news artists, graphic reporters, developers, etc.) who design news graphics are expected to be full-fledged journalists and work closely with reporters and editors. The purpose of this class is to learn how to think about the visual presentation of data, how and why it works, and how to doit the right way. We will learn how to make graphs like The New York Times, Vox, Pew, and FiveThirtyEight. In the end, you can shareï¿½embed your beautiful charts in publications, blog posts, and websites.

Data Collection: Online, Telephone and Face-to-face;University of Michigan;Beginner;This course presents research conducted to increase our understanding of how data collection decisions affect survey errors. This is not a ï¿½howï¿½to-do-itï¿½ course on data collection, but instead reviews the literature on survey design decisions and data quality in order to sensitize learners to how alternative survey designs might impact the data obtained from those surveys.  The course reviews a range of survey data collection methods that are both interview-based (face-to-face and telephone) and self-administered (paper questionnaires that are mailed and those that are implemented online, i.e. as web surveys). Mixed mode designs are also covered as well as several hybrid modes for collecting sensitive information e.g., self-administering the sensitive questions in what is otherwise a face-to-face interview. The course also covers newer methods such as mobile web and SMS (text message) interviews, and examines alternative data sources such as social media. It concentrates on the impact these techniques have on the quality of survey data, including error from measurement, nonresponse, and coverage, and assesses the tradeoffs between these error sources when researchers choose a mode or survey design.;survey data collection  web  survey methodology  mobile web  interview  self-administration  alternative data  Survey Design  respondent  Survey Research life-sciences psychology;0

Words Spun Out of Images: Visual and Literary Culture in Nineteenth Century Japan;The University of Tokyo;Intermediate;In their ambition to capture ï¿½real life;ï¿½ Japanese painters, poets, novelists and photographers of the nineteenth century collaborated in ways seldom explored by their European contemporaries. This course offers learners the chance to encounter and appreciate behavior, moral standards and some of the material conditions surrounding Japanese artists in the nineteenth century, in order to renew our assumptions about what artistic ï¿½realismï¿½ is and what it meant.  Learners will walk away with a clear understanding of how society and the individual were conceived of and represented in early modern Japan. Unlike contemporary western art forms, which acknowledge their common debt as ï¿½sister artsï¿½ but remain divided by genre and discourse, Japanese visual and literary culture tended to combine, producing literary texts inspired by visual images, and visual images which would then be inscribed with poems and prose. Noticing and being able to interpret this indivisibility of visual/literary cultures is essential in understanding the social and psychological values embedded within the beauty of Japanese art.;2

Soul Beliefs: Causes and Consequences - Unit 1: Historical Foundations;Rutgers the State University of New Jersey;Beginner;Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have, however defined, a ï¿½soul.ï¿½ While the question of whether the soul exists cannot be answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.  The course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into 3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences.  These videos include slides and some embedded video clips.  Most lectures are accompanied by slides used during the lecture, also including recommended reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities to reflect on your studies.

A Business Approach to Sustainable Landscape Restoration;Erasmus University Rotterdam;Beginner;Integrated landscape management and large-scale landscape restoration should be in every companyï¿½s business strategy because in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goal on Land Degradation Neutrality (SDG Number 15.3) scaling up and acceleration of business-driven landscape restoration is urgently needed.  This requires business professionals with a vision, the right knowledge and skills. This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge businessï¿½ interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.  ï¿½Historically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But weï¿½re all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.ï¿½  Tï¿½a Obreht,  The New Yorker, Dec. 19&26, 2016, p. 106.  It is a frightening prospect indeed ï¿½ that all life on Earth must either adapt or be doomed. This course is about landscape degradation ï¿½ a global and wicked problem that is contributing to the dooming prospect of depletion of Earthï¿½s finite resources. But this course is also about the solutions to this problem ï¿½ business driven landscape restoration. So rather than leaving you powerless with the prospect Obreht puts fowards above, it is our hope that you learn how you can be part of the solution to making sure that Planet Earth still provides a safe and habitable home for future generations.  We must act big and we must act now. With this course we want to pass on valuable knowledge and teach you useful skills that you can apply in your professional life that will enable you to tackle the issue of landscape degradation and restoration.  The issue is urgent, so letï¿½s dive right into it.

Mind of the Universe: Science in Progress;Erasmus University Rotterdam;Advanced;From William Harvey discovering the circulation of blood to Albert Einstein developing the theory of relativity: almost all scientific research starts from something odd and unexpected that hasn't been explained yet, and, subsequently, the scientist creatively imagining possible explanations for it, formulating hypotheses.  However, the problem with formulating hypotheses is the theory-ladenness of observation: ones expectations and background theories curtail and determine what one observes. The best way to reduce the negative consequences of theory-ladenness of observation as much as possible, is not by adopting the highest methodological standards, but by continuing to think outside the box throughout the problem solving process, by tirelessly, creatively imagining alternative explanations and hypotheses.  In this learning experience you will be turned upside down by philosopher Tim de Mey, who will challenge you to think outside of your comfort zone. You will be challenged to reflect critically and creatively on what triggers your research, i.e., what is driving the scientist in you. Tim will show you how openness to and interaction with other disciplines generates new ideas, and how important it is that scientists, besides the possibilities of their own discipline, are also aware of its (and there) limitations. Take this challenge and you will construct the perfect out-of-the-box research question that will tease the Mind of the Universe scientists to explore even better answers in their research.  This online learning experience is a spin-off of The Mind of the Universe documentary series created by the Dutch broadcasting company VPRO and professor Robbert Dijkgraaf, Princeton University.

Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis;EIT Digital;Advanced;Welcome to Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis. In this course, you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in a fashion popular in theoretical computer science, and generally train your abstract thinking skills.     After finishing this course, you have learned to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption, and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets, about timing, and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems, and for the special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs, you will know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics, like throughput, latency and buffering.  Disclaimer: As you will notice, there is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically, it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow. So this course is a good primer for any more Advanced course on the topic.  This course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital university, and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven), TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente). The course material is exactly the same as the first three weeks of QEES, but the examination of QEES is at a slightly higher level of difficulty, which cannot (yet) be obtained in an online course.;data-flow analysis  prefix order  graphs  set theory  formal language  dataflow  interpretation  euler's totient function  mathematical optimization  petri net computer-science software-development;1

Know Thyself - The Value and Limits of Self-Knowledge: The Examined Life;The University of Edinburgh;Beginner;According to legend, inscribed on walls of the temple on the sacred site of Delphi in Ancient Greece were two premier injunctions: NOTHING IN EXCESS, and KNOW THYSELF. This course will be an examination of the latter injunction in an effort to discover what self-knowledge is, why it might be valuable, and what, if any, limitations it might face. What is missing from a person lacking in self-knowledge that makes her less wise, virtuous, or competent in certain areas than others who have this capacity, and what if anything might she do to fill that gap?  Historical sources as well as recent research in philosophy, experimental social psychology, and neuroscience will inform our investigation, in the course of which we will become students of our own dreams, and cultivate some meditative practices.  Learning Outcomes:  Learners will gain familiarity with prominent themes from Western, classical Chinese, and Buddhist approaches to our knowledge of ourselves.

The course also focuses on the application of learning technologies and new media to meet the needs of diverse populations of learners. Its main practical question is, how do we use educational technologies to create learning environments in which learning experiences can be customized and calibrated to meet the precise needs of particular learners? Topics include: universal design for learning, differentiated instruction systems, and adaptive and personalized learning environments.  -------------------------------- Related Resources --------------------------------  This course is based on the following book:  https://www.amazon.com/New-Learning-Mary-Kalantzis-ebook/dp/B0096R1FUM  Additional online resources are available here:  https://newlearningonline.com/new-learning  -------------------------------- Take this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois --------------------------------  This course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the Learning Design and Leadership Program in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.

Introduction to Reinforcement Learning in Python;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;In this project-based course, we will explore Reinforcement Learning in Python. Reinforcement Learning, or RL for short, is different from supervised learning methods in that, rather than being given correct examples by humans, the AI finds the correct answers for itself through a predefined framework of reward signals.  In this course, we will discuss theories and concepts that are integral to RL, such as the Multi-Arm Bandit problem and its implications, and how  Markov Decision processes can be leveraged to find solutions. Then we will implement code examples in Python of basic Temporal Difference algorithms and Monte Carlo techniques. Finally, we implement an example of Q-learning in Python.  I would encourage learners to experiment with the tools and methods discussed in this course. The learner is highly encouraged to experiment beyond the scope of the course.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. Weï¿½re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.;Computer Programming  project  Experiment  Reinforcement Learning  reinforcement  Python Programming  Algorithms  Integral  supervision  Machine Learning data-science machine-learning;0

Molecular Evolution (Bioinformatics IV);University of California San Diego;Advanced;In the previous course in the Specialization, we learned how to compare genes, proteins, and genomes.  One way we can use these methods is in order to construct a Tree of Life showing how a large collection of related organisms have evolved over time.  In the first half of the course, we will discuss approaches for evolutionary tree construction that have been the subject of some of the most cited scientific papers of all time, and show how they can resolve quandaries from finding the origin of a deadly virus to locating the birthplace of modern humans.  In the second half of the course, we will shift gears and examine the old claim that birds evolved from dinosaurs.  How can we prove this?  In particular, we will examine a result that claimed that peptides harvested from a T. rex fossil closely matched peptides found in chickens. In particular, we will use methods from computational proteomics to ask how we could assess whether this result is valid or due to some form of contamination.  Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to reconstruct an evolutionary tree of ebolaviruses and identify the source of the recent Ebola epidemic that caused global headlines.;Bioinformatics  phylogenetic tree  introduction to evolution  Molecular Evolution  hindley milner type system  evolution  computational biology  phylogenetics  genomics  biotechnology life-sciences health-informatics;1
The Data Science of Health Informatics;Johns Hopkins University;Beginner;Health data are notable for how many types there are, how complex they are, and how serious it is to get them straight. These data are used for treatment of the patient from whom they derive, but also for other uses. Examples of such secondary use of health data include population health (e.g., who requires more attention), research (e.g., which drug is more effective in practice), quality (e.g., is the institution meeting benchmarks), and translational research (e.g., are new technologies being applied appropriately). By the end of this course, students will recognize the different types of health and healthcare data, will articulate a coherent and complete question, will interpret queries designed for secondary use of EHR data, and will interpret the results of those queries.;health data  vital signs  Databases  data type  informatics  data quality  Data Management  analytics  Big Data  medication life-sciences health-informatics;0
Ethical Social Media;The University of Sydney;Advanced;Social media connects us across space and time, allowing us to find like-minded communities and participate creatively in public life as never before.  We may often use social media without thinking much about the possible consequences.   But there is a shadow side associated with social media use, which takes the form of hate speech, increased surveillance, lack of anonymity and questionable use of our data. What do we need to know to use social media spaces effectively, in a way that is safe and productive for all?  This course will guide you into a deeper exploration of online identity, social media communities and their users.  You will examine the ways that social media is being used by public institutions such as government to build participation and conversation with audiences.  You will encounter the most common ethical debates in social media.    You will also have the opportunity to build your practical skills by developing your professional social media profile, defining your audience, building your social media influence and understanding how to interpret data analytics to listen and communicate well.;online community  community management  ordered pair  media campaigns  Social Media  Communication  analytics  social media analytics  media technology  social media campaigns social-sciences governance-and-society;1
Creating Database Tables with SQL;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;In this course you will experience the process of defining, creating, and managing relational database tables using the SQL language. Tables are used as the containers for the data in a database. As such, the structure, or makeup, of each table in a relational database is critical, since it must be designed and created specifically to meet the needs of the data it will contain. The tableï¿½s structure indicates which pieces of data are stored in a table, as well as the type and size of each piece of data.   Throughout the course, youï¿½ll be exposed to guidelines and rules that database designers use to make sure that the tables will keep the data as safe and accurate as possible. Youï¿½ll learn to use SQL code to incorporate the constraints that help the database management enforce those rules. As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, youï¿½ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  Tables that are well-designed and created correctly improve data integrity--and make data retrieval easier!  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. Weï¿½re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.;SQL  HTML5  mysql  database management systems  Database Design  relational database  table (database)  Accuracy And Precision  Databases  data retrieval information-technology data-management;0
Mastering SQL Joins;Coursera Project Network;Advanced;In this 2-hour long project-based course, you will understand how to use SQL joins like INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN to get a desired result set. In addition, you will learn how to use SQL Joins with the WHERE clause and with aggregate functions. By extension, you will learn how to join more than two tables in the database.  Note: You do not need to be a data administrator or data analyst expert to be successful in this guided project, just you have to be familiar with querying databases using SQL SELECT statement to get the most of this project. If you are not familiar with SQL and want to learn the basics, start with my previous guided projects titled ï¿½Performing Data definition and Manipulation in SQL, ï¿½Querying Databases using SQL SELECT statementï¿½ and ï¿½Performing Data Aggregation using SQL Aggregate Functionsï¿½;aggregate function  project  employment  sorting  more than two  modulo operation  Data Analysis  euler's totient function  project mine  ascendency data-science data-analysis;1
Black-box and White-box Testing;University of Minnesota;Advanced;After completing this course, learners will have an understanding of a variety of black-box and white-box testing techniques. The learner will have put this understanding into practice, creating effective sets of test cases (called a test suite) to properly exercise software for defect finding.

Version Control with Git;Atlassian;Intermediate;The Version Control with Git course provides  you with a solid, hands-on foundation for understanding the Git version control system.  Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs.  It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing.   In this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently know just enough Git to be dangerous.   There are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)  You can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux.   This course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub).   This course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 5-10 hours to go through one of the two paths, but your mileage may vary.;version control  command-line interface  git (software)  bitbucket  software  software versioning  github  distributed version control  version control systems  Mergers & Acquisitions computer-science software-development;2
The Modern World, Part Two: Global History since 1910;University of Virginia;Beginner;This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective.

Free Speech on Campus Teach-Out;University of Michigan;Beginner;Free speech is essential for a healthy, vibrant, and democratic society. Yet, the idea of freedom of speech on university campuses is challenged by the ever-evolving social and political realities of a contemporary democracy. This Teach-Out prompts participants to think critically about the role free speech plays on university campuses and how this discourse shapes the broader narrative about free speech protection across the United States. Why is free speech suddenly an issue on university campuses? Is speech or safety at the crux of the issue? How has the definition of free speech evolved between the 20th and 21st centuries and how are universities addressing these changes?  This Teach-Out is part of the University of Michigan 2018 Speech and Inclusion Series that aims to recognize differing views on speech and inclusion, to explore how those views play out in politics, culture, higher education, sports, and journalism, and to engage in productive conversations to promote a positive campus environment and help the community more deeply understand these complicated issues.  A Teach-Out is:  -an event ï¿½ it takes place over a fixed, short period of time  -an opportunity ï¿½ it is open for free participation to everyone around the world  -a community ï¿½ it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals  -a conversation ï¿½ an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people  The University of Michigan Teach-Out Series provides just-in-time community learning events for participants around the world to come together in conversation with the U-M campus community, including faculty experts. The U-M Teach-Out Series is part of our deep commitment to engage the public in exploring and understanding the problems, events, and phenomena most important to society.

Introduction to Learning Transfer and Life Long Learning (3L);University of California, Irvine;Beginner;Learn how to identify the enablers and barriers to learning transfer. Use your own experience to categorise the processes and activities involved in learning and transferring that learning into practice. There are many criteria against which the success of training and development activities can be judged. One of the most important, however, is learning transfer. Ultimately, the success of any given training and/or development program is reflected in whether or not what is learned is applied on the job. Organisations - and indeed trainees themselves - invest large amounts of time, effort, and resources in work-related training and generally expect to see this manifested in some way back in the work setting (e.g. as observable changes to how work is conducted). However, many organisations and their people view the likelihood of transfer of training more in hope than expectation. This course will show you how to approach the goal of improving learning transfer in your organisation.;peer support  motivation  education  evaluation  training and development  customer service training  Training Programs  enabling  Training  experience business business-essentials;0
Big-O Time Complexity in Python Code;Coursera Project Network;Beginner;In the field of data science, the volumes of data can be enormous, hence the term Big Data. It is essential that algorithms operating on these data sets operate as efficiently as possible. One measure used is called Big-O time complexity. It is often expressed not in terms of clock time, but rather in terms of the size of the data it is operating on. For example, in terms of an array of size N, an algorithm may take N^2 operations to complete. Knowing how to calculate Big-O gives the developer another tool to make software as good as it can be and provides a means to communicate performance when reviewing code with others.  In this course, you will analyze several algorithms to determine Big-O performance. You will learn how to visualize the performance using the graphing module pyplot.

Fundamentals of Macroscopic and Microscopic Thermodynamics;University of Colorado Boulder;Beginner;Course 1 first explores the basics of both macroscopic and microscopic thermodynamics from a postulatory point of view. In this view, the meaning of temperature, thermodynamic pressure and chemical potential are especially clear and easy to understand. In addition , the development of the Fundamental Relation and its various transformations leads to a clear path to property relations and to the concept of ensembles needed to understand the relationship between atomic and molecular structural properties and macroscopic properties.  We then explore the relationship between atomic and molecular structure and macroscopic properties by taking a statistical point of view. Using a postulatory approach, the method for doing this is made clear. This leads to the development of the partition function which describes the distribution of molecular quantum states as a function of the independent, macroscopic thermodynamic properties.;chemistry  physics  Aerospace Engineering  molecular dynamics  ansys  Chemical Engineering  hemodynamics  fluid mechanics  Mechanical Engineering  statistical mechanics physical-science-and-engineering mechanical-engineering;0

The Finite Element Method for Problems in Physics;University of Michigan;Beginner;This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences. The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.  The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an introductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not formal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a competent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional analysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the methods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite Element Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical foundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner presented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed, although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.  The development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs): elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to the physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in one dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We then move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and mass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems in vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next (unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in three dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who followed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical development to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.  Books: There are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required textbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader treatments than can be provided in any form of class:  The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis, T.J.R.

Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity to learn from your fellow photographers' solutions to lighting challenges, and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.    There is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course.  As photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter time, than when you began.  You have also proven that you are a dedicated Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals.  This Course is the last before the Capstone Course, in which you will be tasked with creating a project over a 2-month period of dedicated photography.  The Peer Review photography assignments have been structured with both your Advanced capabilities and dedication in mind...in other words, they will require both!  Be prepared to allocate more time than you have in previous Courses for the assignments, because they will take more time and because you will really enjoy them!  Course Four ends with an overview of methods for finalizing your pictures in print form, including simple but effective matting techniques, and in web page designs as well.  The pleasures and perils of sharing in social media sites are also yours to discover.  Protecting your copyrights by understanding that concept and the ways that you can assert them, being careful about blogs and other outlets, and recognizing you are part of a community that respects the individual's creative effort, well that is  important knowledge to have in preparation for the Capstone too!

Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes (Bioinformatics III);University of California San Diego;Advanced;Once we have sequenced genomes in the previous course, we would like to compare them to determine how species have evolved and what makes them different.  In the first half of the course, we will compare two short biological sequences, such as genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or proteins.  We will encounter a powerful algorithmic tool called dynamic programming that will help us determine the number of mutations that have separated the two genes/proteins.  In the second half of the course, we will zoom out to compare entire genomes, where we see large scale mutations called genome rearrangements, seismic events that have heaved around large blocks of DNA over millions of years of evolution.  Looking at the human and mouse genomes, we will ask ourselves: just as earthquakes are much more likely to occur along fault lines, are there locations in our genome that are fragile and more susceptible to be broken as part of genome rearrangements?  We will see how combinatorial algorithms will help us answer this question.  Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to solve problems in sequence alignment, including BLAST.;sequence alignment  longest path problem  dnas  Bioinformatics  protein  genomics  evolution  sequence alignment algorithms  genome  human genome life-sciences health-informatics;1

Exploring Basic Income in a Changing Economy Teach-Out;University of Michigan;Beginner;The United States social safety net is a complex system with many programs and often difficult eligibility requirements. Many of these programs only deliver in-kind aid (not cash) to people living in poverty, a lot of whom can fall through the cracks and canï¿½t make ends meet.   Basic income, the idea of providing people with a minimal level of cash support on a consistent basis, remains a point of debate in the United States and beyond. In this Teach-Out, you will join leading experts to explore the emerging idea of basic income and other associated social safety net programs.   The Teach-Out will address the following questions: What is basic income? What is the difference between basic income and universal basic income? Why is basic income generating so much interest now? How does basic income work? What are the benefits and the challenges? How might basic income help create an inclusive economy? What is the social safety net? Who does it help and who does it leave out? How do we currently measure poverty and determine who is eligible for safety net programs?  How do automation and a changing economy affect the basic income conversation?   Note: This Teach-Out originally launched in July 2018. Some of the examples, studies discussed, and perspectives may have changed since we recorded these conversation, but the core content of the Teach-Out remains extremely relevant today. Please enjoy this relaunched version of the Teach-Out, we encourage you to engage in the discussion forums with other learners.;basic income  insurance policy  economy  digital signature  income  phenomenon  Policy Research  financial statement  baby bonus  negative income tax business finance;0

Stalin and Stalinism in Russian History;National Research University Higher School of Economics;Beginner;The course presents the life and deeds of Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union from 1924 till 1953. It analyses the reasons for his actions and their results, as well as the causes of his popularity in Russia today. It offers an analysis of the phenomenon of Stalinism and of its significance for Russia and beyond.  In the late 1920s ï¿½ early 1930s Stalin directed the massive and rapid industrialisation of the country and the forced collectivisation of its agriculture. The industrialisation was based on forced labour, and collectivisation on repression, but both helped to create the material base for the Soviet defence industry. In the late 1930s Stalin unleashed mass terror against the Soviet people, in which millions perished. In his view this helped to rid the country of any potential internal enemies on the eve of the coming war.    The USSR, together with its allies, won the Second World War, but at the cost of dozens of millions of lives. Stalin was instrumental in creating the post-war order. The system which he created in the 1930s shaped the USSR as it was during his lifetime and for decades after his death. It also influenced the lives of millions of people beyond the Soviet borders.   The course will enable those who take it to develop an informed understanding of the Stalin era and of the phenomenon of Stalinism.   Do you have technical problems?

Lecture Series for Preventing and Controlling COVID-19;Xi'an Jiaotong University;Beginner;In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause appeared in Wuhan, Hubei. Governments at all levels and Department of Health Administration highly valued and rapidly organized the centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), medical institutions, and scientific research academies to conduct a survey, rescue, and collaborative research. This new antigen was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus, named as 2019-nCoV by World Health Organization (WHO). Meanwhile, the pneumonia caused by it was named as novel coronavirus pneumonia. Implementing the decisions by the CPC Central Committee and State Council with Xi at the core, the whole country took comprehensive actions in social mobilization and deployment, taking epidemic control a most important work in the immediate future. The spread of the epidemic has been effectively controlled. However, novel coronavirus has spread to the whole world thereafter, so it called for closer international cooperation in epidemic prevention and control. Based on this situation, it was urgent to set a new MOOC program about COVID-19 and impart scientific knowledge of the disease to foreign students, undergraduate students, and all the other common people abroad, laying a solid foundation for the triumph of the war against COVID-19. The novel coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus that had never been found in humans before. This huge family already known can cause cold or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and other severe diseases. The main signs and symptoms of the infected people include respiratory symptoms, fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea, etc. In severe and critical cases, there will appear pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. The two-month war against COVID-19 has helped us accumulate loads of experience in disease prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment, which can be shared with the whole world as a reference. In front of the need of our students and common people on COVID-19 prevention knowledge, the Health Science Center of Xiï¿½an Jiaotong University has organized related experts to issue the English lectures of the epidemic prevention and control for people at home and abroad and international community.

Building Modern Java Applications on AWS;Amazon Web Services;Advanced;In modern cloud native application development, itï¿½s oftentimes the goal to build out serverless architectures that are scalable, are highly available, and are fully managed. This means less operational overhead for you and your business, and more focusing on the applications and business specific projects that differentiate you in your marketplace. In this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS.   Building brand new applications on AWS is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into AWS. When you have an existing application that you need to move to AWS, you might first look to using Amazon EC2 as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application. \t`  Building Modern Java Applications on AWS will explore how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as youï¿½ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API.   Then we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. Youï¿½ll learn about how the authorization flow works with Cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks. Youï¿½ll learn about the different configurations that exist for Lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions. Some of the features of our API will require multiple lambda functions to execute in a specific order, like a workflow, and we will use AWS Step Functions to create a serverless workflow. Finally, we will talk about how to optimize your APIs at every layer using AWS features.  Note: There are three versions of this class, Building Modern Node.js Applications on AWS for Node.js developers, Building Modern Python Applications on AWS for Python developers, and Building Modern Java Applications on AWS for Java developers.  The courses do for a large part, overlap and in general, we recommend that you take the course that focuses on the SDK you plan to use to develop your AWS Cloud based applications.  We expect that you have basic knowledge of AWS already. Some examples of concepts you should be familiar with are: you should know the basics of the AWS Global infrastructure, like what regions and availability zones are. You also should know the at a high-level AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM, and how it is used to control access to AWS resources. You should also understand what an Amazon EC2 instance is, what Amazon S3 is, what a VPC is, as well as other basic AWS terminology.;application programming interfaces  mathematical optimization  euler's totient function  https  Kubernetes  command-line interface  event-driven architecture  modeling  Benefits  Amazon Web Services information-technology cloud-computing;1

At the Origins of the Mediterranean Civilization: Archaeology of the City from the Levant to the West - 3rd-1st millennium BC;Sapienza University of Rome;Beginner;Which are the deepest roots of that mix of cultures that we use to call ï¿½Mediterranean Civilizationï¿½? Which are comminglings and exchanges which produced its most complete fruit, i.e. the city, a place for landscape-modelling communities? And which elements did contribute to build up that baulk of customs, ideas, and innovations which compelled to confrontation and hybridizations different peoples for millennia? What did it made, from pottery to metallurgy, from gastronomy to architecture, from art to religion, of a sea a cradle of civilization? Archaeology may help in disentangling such questions, seeking unexpected answers , by tinkering what ancient Mediterranean peoples left buried in the ground.

The three earlier courses in this series covered statistical thinking, correlation, linear regression and logistic regression. This one will show you how to run survival ï¿½ or ï¿½time to eventï¿½ ï¿½ analysis, explaining whatï¿½s meant by familiar-sounding but deceptive terms like hazard and censoring, which have specific meanings in this context. Using the popular and completely free software R, youï¿½ll learn how to take a data set from scratch, import it into R, run essential descriptive analyses to get to know the dataï¿½s features and quirks, and progress from Kaplan-Meier plots through to multiple Cox regression. Youï¿½ll use data simulated from real, messy patient-level data for patients admitted to hospital with heart failure and learn how to explore which factors predict their subsequent mortality. Youï¿½ll learn how to test model assumptions and fit to the data and some simple tricks to get round common problems that real public health data have. There will be mini-quizzes on the videos and the R exercises with feedback along the way to check your understanding.  Prerequisites  Some formulae are given to aid understanding, but this is not one of those courses where you need a mathematics degree to follow it. You will need basic numeracy (for example, we will not use calculus) and familiarity with graphical and tabular ways of presenting results. The three previous courses in the series explained concepts such as hypothesis testing, p values, confidence intervals, correlation and regression and showed how to install R and run basic commands. In this course, we will recap all these core ideas in brief, but if you are unfamiliar with them, then you may prefer to take the first course in particular, Statistical Thinking in Public Health, and perhaps also the second, on linear regression, before embarking on this one.;Missing Data  Survival Analysis  analysis  R Programming  Proportional Hazards Model  Regression Analysis  General Statistics  modeling  public health  log-rank test life-sciences public-health;1
Fundamentals of Immunology: Death by Friendly Fire;Rice University;Intermediate;Course 3 of a three course specialization called Fundamentals of Immunology. Each course in the specialization presents material that builds on the previous course's material.  This is the third leg of the journey through the defenses your body uses to keep you healthy. In the first course we learned about innate immunity and B cell function. In the second course we studied T cell function and coordination of the immune response.  Fundamentals of Immunology: Death by Friendly Fire introduces students to the basic functions of the adaptive and innate immune systems. The early lectures survey cells, tissues and organs using metaphors, cartoons and models to improve understanding and retention. After describing the form, function, origin and varieties of antibodies, subsequent lectures provide details on the mechanism of the generation of variation. The course provides animations of gene rearrangement and class switching and descriptions of affinity maturation correlated with detailed physical models of antibody structure. The final lecture reviews these concepts in anatomical context. Testing employs multiple choice questions testing facts, concepts, and application of principles. Questions may refer to diagrams, drawing and photographs used in lecture and reproduced in the outline.  What Youï¿½ll Learn:  A survey of immune cells and how they attack pathogens, with emphasis on the mechanism of inducing apoptosis and details of Antibody Directed Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity. The inflammatory response and mechanisms of generating tolerance, presented in sequence to emphasize the decision making involved in controlling attacks. A survey of autoimmune disease, their characteristics, cause and treatment. Survey of hypersensitivity reactions, including allergy, anaphylaxis, anemias, granulomas, and a variety of skin responses. This is accompanied by identification, prevention and treatment. The final discussion of preventing transplant rejection is preceded by a detailed unit on antibody technology and the methods of testing for incompatibility.;kill (command)  death  autoimmune disease  biochemistry  genetics  Cancer  immune system  immunology  biology  assay life-sciences basic-science;2
