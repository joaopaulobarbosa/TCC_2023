Beginner;ï½ is the first course in the upcoming sustainability and development mastertrack certificate program fall 2020 but you can also take this course as a standalone learning opportunity   sustainability and development pose unprecedented challenges as human societies grow and seek to ensure future wellbeing and prosperity in this course weï½ll focus on addressing the twin challenges of sustainability and development with actionable knowledge for innovating solutions to the worldï½s most pressing problems like climate change poverty and inequality and biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation rather than sustainability being a qualifier for development eg sustainable development we conceptualize sustainability and development as coequal fields of inquiry and action that seek to build bridges between the natural social and applied sciences and the humanities when sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing it requires us to think more explicitly about the tradeoffs cobenefits and synergies between them which we will be exploring in depth in each week  throughout the course you will be introduced to the theoretical currents in sustainability and development and will garner an indepth understanding of the united nationsï½ 17 sustainable development goals sdgs we will also consider the methods and skills necessary for designing innovative solutions to sustainability and development problems through the emerging field of sustainability science  in this course we will explore three of the most pressing challenges undergirding the  sustainable development goals sdgs including climate change poverty and inequality and ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss with case studies to guide and challenge our thinking in the final week of the course we will discuss the tradeoffs cobenefits and synergies between these challenges especially as they relate to designing innovative solutions for achieving  our sustainability and development goals  by the end of this course you will be able to 1 understand and explain the worldï½s most pressing problems with a specific focus on poverty  inequality ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and climate change 2 critically analyze the sustainable development goals sdgs and their relationship to the worldï½s most pressing problems 3 use frameworks and evidence necessary to develop solutions 4 assess relevant solutions that would help realize the sdgs and at the same time solve the pressing problems  5 apply skills learned to implement solutions;University of Michigan;0

Beginner;  in our second case study for this course loan default prediction you will tackle financial data and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank these tasks are an examples of classification one of the most widely used areas of machine learning with a broad array of applications including ad targeting spam detection medical diagnosis and image classification   in this course you will create classifiers that provide stateoftheart performance on a variety of tasks  you will become familiar with  the most successful techniques which are most widely used in practice including logistic regression decision trees and boosting  in addition you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale using stochastic gradient ascent  you will implement these technique on realworld largescale machine learning tasks  you will also address significant tasks you will face in realworld applications of ml including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier  this course is handson actionpacked and full of visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data  weve also included optional content in every module covering advanced topics for those who want to go even deeper   learning objectives by the end of this course you will be able to    describe the input and output of a classification model    tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems    implement a logistic regression model for largescale classification      create a nonlinear model using decision trees    improve the performance of any model using boosting    scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent    describe the underlying decision boundaries      build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset      analyze financial data to predict loan defaults    use techniques for handling missing data    evaluate your models using precisionrecall metrics    implement these techniques in python or in the language of your choice though python is highly recommended;University of Washington;0
